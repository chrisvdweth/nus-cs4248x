1,"Excellent food, great atmosphere, a bit noisy.  $$"
2,"If you enjoy a little people watching with your dining, sit out on the outside terrace and watch Las Vegas tourist walk the strip as they celebrate their winnings or rave about the fabulous Bellagio fountains.  As the restaurant is directly across from the fountains, it is also a great place to dine while taking in the free show.   The food fits the setting, with a traditional French menu infused with a bit of Vegas penache.   We had excellent service..polite, prompt, helpful (great at helping us pick a great wine suited to our selections!) and personal.   And by the way,   the wait staff aren't above snapping that great snapshot of you and your guest having a good time....it is great to be a tourist!"
3,"affordable, fairly classic french foodsit outside if you like to people watchor see the bellagio fountain showvery reminiscent of paris(on steroids!)"
4,"Though heartbroken and a bit aimless on my 22nd birthday, a meal at Mon Ami Gabi really helped cheer me up.I imagine that if you go there relatively happy, you'd really enjoy yourself!"
5,"The food and wine was amazing, but the super high price is going to make this a 4-star.  Although I must admit that the price was a direct result of ordering numerous glasses of wine rather than a bottle.  Dumb.  But it was the best meal we had in Vegas, so call it a 4.5"
6,"Yippy!  Make-your-own bloody mary bar! Chose the vodka and go to town.  They have recipies to help you out if you need it.  We tried Mon Ami Gabi for Sunday brunch.  First off, I loved eating in the atrium (light, airy and classic), and probably prefered it to eating outside (who wants to feel like they're right on the strip amidst icky large groups and las vegas grime while spending a bit for brunch?).  Secondly, the service was OUTSTANDING.  The waitress even put in a special request for a specific  crepe filling not on the menu (the kitchen made it- smoked salmon, egg and jack cheese if you're curious).  Crepes were enormous and delicious (just too bad I couldn't lug a doggie bag around with me all day).  Not too expensive ($50 with tax and tip and champagne) .Yumyumyum. Will definatley go again."
7,"I went here for a team function on one of the evening's of my company's sales conference.  The place was a little crowded and dim but it was a festive and enjoyable experience.The waiter was great and definitely made the experience better.  We shared 6 bottles of wine, 5 appetizers, and 3 salads.  I am not a big fan of pate, but you definitely have to try it here.  The Mon Ami Shrimp Gabi wasn't quite as good as advertised, but I loved the scallops.One of the special's of the day was Beef Wellington, and basically I made up my mind right there.  Half of the group did the same.  The dish was in a nice wine reduction mushroom sauce and sauteed spinach.  The crust was flakey and the beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender.The price was a bit steep, but hey it's Vegas.  I don't particularly like the Paris hotel and casion, but I'd definitely come to Mon Ami Gabi again."
8,"An affordable dining experience in Paris, I mean Vegas.  Location was built out perfectly to the French theme.  They had tasty appetizers with the country pate and the garlic simmered shrimp.  The burger was cooked well with a large amount of fries.  The bread that they serve before the meal can be, ""cut the top of your mouth hard"" so be careful.  A local recommended the french onion soup, but I totally forgot to get that.  Great views if you get the outdoor seating!"
9,"Definitely one of my favorites on the Strip! I've been here several times and it has never disappointed! The food here is wonderful as well as the service.  Their steaks are fabulous, as well as their seafood.  Worth a visit if you've never been!"
10,"What great friends I have..... We ate at Mon Ami Gabi translation (My friend Gabi) last Sat. night.  It was awesome!  It is located in the (wait for it..... Paris Hotel).  What more can a grl who loves Paris ask for?  Me and my 6 grl friends had a delicious array of cocktails, appetizers, and entrees that would make any American say Oh La La!  C'est Bon N'est Pas?  I had the Dijon crusted salmon and I couldn't stop eating once I got full. I had to beg the waiter to take my plate.  To top it off we got a round of creme brulee and chocolate mousse (Ma favorite!).  Sa delicieux!  The atmosphere on in the cafe and the outside terrace was spectacular.... Especially when you have a front seat row to the Bellagio light show.  Sa Magnifique!  Je serai retourner bientot!"
11,Very good. There is a bunch of tourist trap bullshit in Vegas. This is not it. The food is fantastic for the price. The bloody mary bar is a lot of fun. Definitely recommended.
12,Mon Ami Gabi(Paris hotel) The restaurant is nice but you'll want tobe either on the patio or at one of the window seats as that is thetrue charm here. They have taken full advantage of the fountainsacross the street at the Bellagio and this is a great viewing site.Thefood is excellent and price wise compares with other steakhousesin town. The steaks are served with FRITES which can best bedescribed as flat french fries. Beware the bleu cheese new yorksteak as it is loaded with bleu which tended to drown the flavor ofan excellent steak. The butter enhanced steaks seem to be afavorite and I enjoyed that as well. Nice romantic and worth a datenight. Again it is to your advantage to be able to view the fountainsotherwise this is just another restaurant. AuRevoir
13,"Overall, a great restaurant! Not too overpriced- of course price will depend on your hunger, pocket and taste. This is perhaps the only restaurant that allows you to sit outside & view the beautiful Bellagio Musical Fountain show (every 15 minutes or so), while enjoying fine gourmet French-American cuisine.I'd give it 5 stars, except for the following few reasons:1. it is slightly on the noisy side (being on the busy 10-lane Las Vegas Blvd S)2. It takes more than an hour to get seated outside, due to the popularity.3. Some of the waiters are not very friendly or personable. Especially this one guy called Kareem: he is too moody for a waiter at a French restaurant. And unpredictable... He snapped at me in a very unkind way for simply telling him we're ready to order ""why- are you in a hurry?"" No, I am not in a hurry, but we waited over 80 minutes to sit here! ""Well I have so many customers before you"". I guess you must be overworked, Kareem- but it is none of my business. As far as I am concerned, you still need to treat me as a valued customer! I don't deserve to be given attitude in front of my lady. At a restaurant that costs $60 or more per person...Other than that... highly recommended!Our favorites here are:- Escargots Bernaise- Warm baguette bread- Delicious ""Market Salad"" with fresh tomatoes- Belgian Endive Salad (with blue cheese and pears).- Steak au Poivre (peppercorn wine sauce)- prepared medium- Red wine from Burgundy (around $7.50 per glass) sorry cannot recall the name :) - goes so well with the meat!- Creme Brulee - amazing- Tarte Tatin - apple & cinnamon- but ummm, so yummy, so warm, so sensual. Not your average apple cobbler!"
14,"Do they have to have frites with every entree? And the frites, pretty standard. Cheap by vegas standards for food .Decent view of Bellagio fountain show. You will be sorely disappointed if you expect this place to be a decent French bistro."
15,"This is a great place for brunch -- we ended up coming here 2 days in a row!  The belgian waffles with nutella are to die for, and the smoked salmon quiche is amazing.  They also have a great bloody mary bar and a bellini/mimosa cart."
16,Slightly noisy but great food in Vegas at a very reasonable price.  The steaks were great and the appetizers were a bit heavy but it's French cuisine after all.  Sitting outside is great but hard to get on a weekend night.  Make a reservation on Opentable before you go to Vegas and you'll have no problem.Wine list was fairly extensive but we stuck to drinks and the bartender certainly didn't skimp on the drinks.  One of the better finds in Vegas.
17,i had a very rare medium rare fillet mignon here but the rareness was good because it gave the frites some nice flavor. good people watching i got to see a bunch of people eat it on the sidewalk out front those cooling sprinklers provide the perfect amount of moisture on the sidewalk below to make folks feet slide right out from under them good times
18,"I love how many of my favorite restaurants in Chicago have double lives in Vegas!  Had reservations at Mon Ami after our O show at the Bellagio.  Still had a short wait which was OK , took advantage of the open seats at the bar for our over priced french kiss martini.  We got really nice seats overlooking the Bellagio fountain and our server was so upbeat and friendly.  The food was excellent just like all of my other Mon Ami dining experiences.  Great way to start the night!"
19,"amazing french restaurant in the paris hotel. lots of choices for steak and seafood, but delicious appetizers and salads too. very extensive, although pricy, wine list as well. but, you MUST try the french onion soup, it was my favorite thing on the menu the multiple times i've gone there. (ok fine, by multiple i mean twice. but i plan on going there more.) and apparently amazing seats for the bellagio water show. but it's too cold right now for that (december) so for now, sit inside until spring rolls around."
20,"I'm always a little leery about casino restaurants.  And I know, you're all saying...""But, Damon, Vegas is becoming a gourmet capitol.""  Yes, I'm aware of this, but, that doesn't mean that there aren't stinkers out there.Thankfully, Gabi is not one of them.  I've been to Gabi for a wedding party. A simple friends get together.  And on Valentine's Day.  Every trip was completely worth the bill.I'm not gonna give a run down of the menu, mostly because this is the kind of restaurant where you could close you're eyes and point, no matter where it lands you gonna have  a wonderful meal.  ( but make sure what it lands on isn't something you're allergic to, that would suck.)"
21,"My experience at Mon Ami Gabi was amazing, and I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas. Actually I believe that is not the requirement that my girlfriend set next time we go back.Seating & Interiors - Inside is nice, but appears a little crowded and thus can get quite loud. Thankfully i sat outside..no wait at all for our table (we showed up at 6:30 pm and had a reservation through open table..15 minutes later, huge line outside the door).  The outside was very nice, with a great view of the Bellagio fountains (very romantic)...and even though it was slightly cold outside, they had a good amount of heaters outside to keep things regulated...was very nice outside.Pricing - very, very fair. Considering most meals were $18-20..except for the $29 Filet Mignon Au Poivre I ordered...Starters were around $10 which is very good as well (hell, Chili's costs almost as much for appetizers)...I believe Desserts were around $8. The only thing slightly pricey were bottles of wine (cheapest bottles $28-35, everything else around $40-70).  Total price including (generous) tip for two people, two appetizers, one dessert, two entrees and a bottle of wine (remember i had the filet)..$128. Service - SPECTACULAR. Our server Juan, was very articulate, friendly, on the ball with everything, and knowledgeable on all the foods.  Examples: it was slightly windy outside, my napkin fell, when i went to pick it up, he was there in an instant, picked it up, and told me he'd get me a clean one.  After eating our baguette, while crunching up he baguette paper, he was immediately at my side to pick up the trash, and offered another baguette. Food - The filet Mignon was delicious, my girlfriend's lemon chicken was perhaps the best chicken I've ever had. At first I was a little scared of having only an 8 ounce steak for fear of being hungry..but i came out quite full..the banana crepe was also delicious. Presentation was nice...although the escargot could've been presented better, but tasted delicious..The Lobster Bisque..was truly to die for.  The baguette was good as well..the Frites weren't my favorite type of frites, but still quite good, filling, crunchy, but with enough potato inside to make it more than a chip. Overall: The prices are very fair, I highly suggest sitting outside, the service is great ( at least my experience was tremendous). The food is awesome. I highly, highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi."
22,"Ate lunch here twice the past week when I was in vegas.French onion soup and open face shrimp salad sandwhich was good.Their salads are kind of bland and have flavors that just don't work all that well...or are not present (the guyere was bland).A solid place to eat if you are at the Paris; but, nothing to crave or look forward to."
23,"really cool location at the paris las vegas hotel...right on the sidewalk so you can check out the array of people types who visit las vegas.  i suggest you avoid the patio seating when it gets warm out.  the tabletops heat up, and the umbrellas do not help.at around 2:30pm on a wednesday afternoon, the hostess said there'd be a 30 minute wait.  it was probably more like 20, and my boyfriend thinks it's a scam to get their patrons to gamble while they wait.  haha.  they are so smart!  my boyfriend blew a dollar on the wheel-of-fortune machine, but gained $15 playing poker at the Poker Room bar.the baguette and butter we were first served was DELICOUS.  quite possibly the most delicous bread and butter i've ever consumed.  i ordered the brie burger, but took it apart because i asked for medium well, and it was more like medium and i prefer my hamburger meat COOKED.  the bun looked delicious, but i wasn't in the mood to carboload.  the fries were pretty yummy.  my boyfriend had the chicken and brie sandwich and that was pretty phenomenal.  it made me feel bad that i ordered a burger.it was just too bad we were sitting outside on the patio in 90+ degree heat.  i couldn't properly enjoy my food under those conditions."
24,"The outdoor seating is a must!  If you get there after 3:00pm you have a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains going off every 1/2 hour.  It really is a venu appropriate for all sorts of occasions-- from a romantic evening for two, to a little girl's 8th birthday party.  (I have seen all kinds of patronage)  Makes sense, I guess, since it is part of a hotel on the Las Vegas strip.Don't miss the French onion soup, for it is divine, and the roast chicken dish is amazing, too.  Be prepared to spend a pretty penny, though, as Mon Ami Gabi is by no means one of those cheapies scattering the strip.  It has always been a special experience for me."
25,"LUNCH - Mon Ami Gabi has pretty tasty food accompanied by a relaxing atmosphere. If you sit outside, you can spy on the streams of tourists passing by and watch (but not hear) the fountains of the Bellagio hotel across the street. Inside are darker rooms as well as a brightly lit atrium type room which lets in light but not so much the weather. Onion soup - very deep flavor; not a very thick broth, but not light. There is plenty of delicious Gruyre cheese on top and some onions in the soup. Lobster bisque w/ orzo - a waiter brings a bowl with a few tiny chunks of lobster and 1/5 cup of orzo rice. Then he pours the lobster bisque out of a little pitcher. The lobster bisque has a slight seafood-y taste but I found it bearable. The bisque is also a little spicy which I really liked! Sauted Spinach & Brie Crpe - a pretty large crepe with lots of brie and very fresh spinach. The crepe skin was a little dry and bland, but the brie and spinach made it better. The crepe also comes with a small side salad on the plate. Classic Quiche Lorraine,  with bacon - the BEST quiche I've had anywhere. It's creamy and eggy and the crust is tender and buttery. The Quiche Lorraine also comes with sweet, caramelized onions scattered throughout the quiche and lends a nice contrast to the salty elements. Vegetable Quiche - same delicious eggy center and tender crust and contains spinach and mushrooms rather than bacon and onions. Liked the textures, but thought it wasn't as flavorful as the Quiche Lorraine. Chicken & Brie Sandwich, caramelized onion and apple - this sandwich came on a soft ciabatta roll. The flavors were light but complemented each other well. The brie was mild and was delicious with the onions and the apples. The sweetness of the apples and onions paired well with the relatively tender chicken breast. Also came with a huge side order of Mon Ami's thin, crispy frites. I still personally prefer my steak fries, but fans of crispy fries should like the frites. Only problem was that some seemed to have been sitting around for a while."
26,"Yes, it's a LEY restaurant, of which there are a skatillion in my hometown of Chicago, yet Mon Ami Gabi is my favorite place to have lunch in Las Vegas.  If you get there early (like, right when they open) you're sure to score a table outside so you can watch a) the people and b) the Bellagio fountains.  In my opinion, that's really the best thing about eating here, although I also love the food and service.  Even though it's smack in the middle of the Strip, they've done their best to recreate a French bistro, right down to the waiters themselves, who are often from France!Everything I've ever eaten here has been tasty.  Maybe I'm just fortunate, or maybe it's just that good!"
27,"I've been to a lot of restaurants in LV.  At one point, the experiences can get all clouded (and no, it's not because I've had one too many).  But I really enjoyed Mon Ami Gabi.  Expect to pay a bit more than what you may have wanted to, but whatever.It opened at 11, we got there at 11:20 and there was a 40-minute wait to sit outside!!  That sounds ridiculous, but my mom really wouldn't have it any other way, so we opted to wait.  Yes, they give you those shiny, shaky pagers so you can keep on gambling while you wait.  The decor was really pretty inside.  They have a Bloody Mary Bar!!!  Always a hit!  Of course by sitting outside, you've got prime views of the Bellagio fountains--so lunch and a show, always nice.I ordered the cheese plate.  Everytime I go to the Paris Hotel, I  must have me a cheese plate.  They've got the good stuff.  My plate came with brie, gorgonzola, and goat cheese.  It was accompanied by apple slices, grapes, and candied dates---the pairings were really good.  It also comes with a couple different breads to choose from.  The coffee was really good, too.  Always a plus.My mom and sister split a fish and chips.  The fish was high class.  This ain't pub food.  It was lightly battered and fried---it looked like the entire fillet of halbut on the plate.  The chips are a bit different.  They're more like homemade potato crunchies than chips or fries.  That was a bit of a disappointment.  Other than that, can't complain."
28,Great place for lunch. We sat on the patio across from the Bellagio fountain. The food was so parisian that the strip could have been replaced by the Champs +D'Eleyse.
29,Get the Filet Mignon with Merlot Butter. Rare.You will get a taste of heaven.
30,"Mon Ami Gabi is a great spot for a nice dinner.  Not quite upscale like the Eiffel Tower restaurant but still a decent place for a meal.  Most will recognize Mon Ami Gabi for being ""that sidewalk cafe at Paris"".  Yup, that place.The wait can get a little long, so you may want to call ahead or put your name down and gamble for a bit.  Thankfully, we didn't have to wait long since we called ahead and were seated promptly.  The staff was very nice and filled our waters without being asked.  The hanger steak was very flavorful and cooked just as requested.  I don't know if it was the alcohol or what, but I loved the steak and it was easily one of the best steaks I've had.  I've never had ""frites"" before (think regular french fries but thinner and less greasy) and they complimented the steak famously.  After a couple martinis and the meal, we finished our meal by enjoying a strawberry crepe.  Not the best I've ever had, but still very tasty and enjoyable.I wouldn't hesitate to visit Mon Ami Gabi again."
31,"Couldn't ask for a better special occassion dinner (parent's anniversary).  Everyone was a bit skeptical at first, especially put off by the wait, but what do you expect on a Saturday night in Vegas?  It was a bit dark in the restaurant (but I like that), and the waiter was good, considering we were undecided and had 2 small children with us.  We ordered mussels and most had the filet with pommes frittes.  We sat inside due to the heat.  It was the best dinner, and it appealed to everyone in our party."
32,"Really really great place.  Small bar, but friendly bartender, made up for the short wait for our reservations.  I don't know how long it takes to be seated without one, but it's in the middle of Paris casino so there's stuff to do in the meantime.  The food is quite good: I had the Ahi tuna salad and mooched off my girlfriend's steak and frites.  The frites are a little funky, but still tasty.  Prices are what you'd expect from a Vegas restaurant, but it's worth it for the food quality and ambiance."
33,"2nd time eating here.  They actually had our reservation for 8 at 7:15, but we didn't get seated until 8pm.  GRRR.  Then again, it was CES week, and there were about 100,000 extra people than a regular week in vegas.  Great service, excellent food.  If you order anything else besides steak, then you have made a horrible mistake.  Most of the steaks were very juicy and tender.  Highly recommended, and definitely would suggest making a reservation well in advance."
34,"Vegas closes down early, and there aren't many decent places to eat on the later side.  And there are many things to steer away from at this restaurant.  The fries, for example.  They call these fries?  And yet, and yet . . . . There are some terrific wines, not horribly priced.  The steak au poivre is terrific, as good as any SF bistro (except for the frites which, frankly, suck).  The salads are executed poorly as to presentation, but the ingredients?  Actually pretty good.   For example, we had a serrano and mozzarella and fig salad.  Big old pile of the jambon, sliced too thickly, and there was no art in the presentation.  It looked like no one cared enough to make it pretty.  But the taste?  Quite good.  All very high end ingredients, and even the dressing was good.  Same with the heirloom tomato salad (flown in, who knew they cared) and the frisee with lardon.  So if you order carefully and not on the outer limits of cuisine (you know, plain and simple, don't get creative), you'll get a good, maybe even a great, late-night meal.  Sit outside and it's perfect.  Just like Paris (except it's the Bellagio fountains and hordes of Americans, so maybe not so much like Paris, except it's outdoor bistro dining, so that's like Paris, right?)"
35,"mother's day lunchbusy busyreservations madeyay we have a tableseated in the well-lighted indoor areanice interiorsea scallops with cheese and carmelized onionssalty and gooey and sweetoh i think i'm going to be nauseousno more scallops for moicreamy chicken & mushroom crepecreamy, yes. not enough to save the dry chickengeez, even i'd make better crepes"
36,"It's always hard deciding where to eat in Vegas bc there are just so many places to choose from.  This was my third time at Mon Ami, and I've loved it every time.  Their bread is so good that I almost always fill on up on it by the time my food arrives.   I always get one of the hanger steaks, which are thin and tender.  I love their pomme frittes, which are similar to potato chips - thin and crispy.  I'm not sure how long the wait is bc I've always made sure to make reservations beforehand and never had to wait long for my table.   Definitely one of my favorites and affordable for someone on my sad salary."
37,"Mon Ami Gabi brunch menu reminds me of SF's Grand Cafe menu. The quiches and French toast plates are comparable to a 3-star menu.The awesome view of the Bellagio water show from the outdoor patio kicks up a star. Of course the patio is great for people watching and sun-soaking.The fifth star is from the ""bom digi bom di deng di deng digigi uu uuu"" Bloody Mary and the full veggie bar with delicious cured carrot sticks, crispy celery sticks, several different olives, a dozen of hot sauces, and best of all, beef jerky to stash in your Bloody Mary."
38,"The food here is very good.  I had a filet with merlot sauce and asparagus that was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.   Others I was with had the scallops, which were raved about, and the escargot, which, while scorching hot, was also good.I tried my first escargot, just because, you never know what you might like.  Me- Not so much with the escargot.This place does lose points on the environment.  It's very cramped and noisy.  Not a really good place for a romantic dinner, but a good place for really good eats."
39,"There is nothing better than sitting outside with your girlfriends drinking champagne eating onion soup and watching the water show at the Bellagio as the afternoon goes by. This is the best patio in Las Vegas. Is it the best French food in the world? No, but hey we are not in Paris anyway. So go, immediately and sit outside on the patio or have brunch on Sunday under the Atrium. Even if you can only stop in for a drink at the bar facing the strip you will be glad you made the effort of finding it. That is a Parisian experience for sure!! And in the more traditional event that you would like to eat dinner inside, that too is a romantic endeavor and one that will light your faces up by candlelight and be a beautiful dinner, I promise.If you would like to sit outside it is the only thing that a reservation is not good for. You must come and sign up as they do not hold tables for anyone. However sometimes I will admit to making a reservation, and then if the wait isn't that long canceling it to sit outside. I know it may be wrong, but you have to know how to work the system to get a good table!!!!!"
40,"I went here once for a friends birthday and was not overly impressed. The wait was a while, but that's what we should expect in Vegas I guess. It had a nice bar area to grab some drinks while you wait, or you could always hit up the card tables which were nearby.The fillet was good, but it was nothing jaw dropping. They cooked the Tuna a friend ordered instead of searing it and kinda made a fuss about it, saying it was lighting or something. I think it was a little over-priced for what you get too. It was nice just to try it, but I dont' think I'd jump to the suggestion of coming here again unless I really had to"
41,"It's a chain restaurant.  And what's with the name of the corporation?  Lettuce Entertain You??  But what a view!  If you're lucky enough to snag one of the outdoor tables, you're almost on top of Las Vegas Boulevard, with a view of The Bellagio fountains.Reservations are not taken for outdoor tables, so it's first come, first served.  I arrived for lunch at 11:20 am, ten minutes before opening time.  That earned me a table next to the railing, with a direct view of The Bellagio.  There was some traffic noise, but nothing terrible.I had Steak Classique: a large (10"" x 8""), thin piece of grilled steak, tender and with very good flavor.  A large pat of herb butter was on top.  Accompanying it was a huge pile of french fries, cut thin like egg noodles and very crisp.  All in all, a good meal in an excellent setting.The bill (including a drink, tax, and tip):  $35."
42,"I really want to give this place 4 1/2 stars, but it seems like its not a Yelp feature.For me, the appeal of this place was being able to sit out in the patio area across the street from the Bellagio fountains and people watch while eating good food. Heat is not a problem (in the warm nights) because they blast you with outdoor air conditioning.Our waitress was not from France but I think she put on a french accent just for kicks (I didn't hear the other servers doing it) which was actually nice.The food is worth the price but nothing spectacular. I do reccommend the scallop appetizer. We saw a guy eating it at the bar and we had to order ourselves and it was very tasty.So why not 5 stars? Just a couple minor technical errors. They overcooked a steak and we had to send it back, and they brought out two Creme Brulee's when we ordered one. Even if they messed up with the steak... I still feel bad sending it back,but thats not something that should happen at $30 a steak."
43,"i'd rate this as a ""high"" 3.5 star which rounds the rating up to 4.me, the wife and the in-laws had a nice dinner here.  i started with an smash of an onion soup that was fully of cheesy goodness.  the wife and the pop-in-law split a salade maison, which was a mixed green salad w/ a house vinagrette and a goat cheese crouton.  they enjoyed it but nothing special for them.  mom-in-law just had sat tight for her entree.  i had the skate, as my entree, which was very tasty but oh so buttery, a bit too much i would say.  the wife had the lemon chicken w/ french cut beans which she found flavorful but a bit overcooked.  pop-in-paw had the thyme-seared salmon which was quite good and mom-in-law had the sampler of vegetables which looked excellent and i tried some beets and was won over.we all split the chocolate mousse for dessert and loved it.  it was a bit thick but they added lil pellets of crunchy chocolate thingies (cue homer) and that just made it!  this itself makes the place a 4 star!the service was good though a bit on the slow side.  our waitress was quite nice to us and very funny too.  she suggested a great pinot noir but i completely forget the name of it but it's the only pinot noir on their wine by the glass list."
44,"I am not an authority on French cuisine, but  I certainly enjoy the food here.  I have been here for dinner and lunch.  My parents and other people that I know that have been here all rave about this place and I agree that it is warranted.Update:  I recommended to one of my co-workers (bona fide French!) and she fully approved of the place.  I steered her away from the buffet (boofet!).The service sometimes leaves a bit to be desired.  I think that it is nice to sit outside when the weather is nice, but the service seems worse out there.  Inside and for dinner, the service seems better.As someone who is tired of most of the casino restaurants, I can't say that I ever tire of this place.  I feel like a lot of the casinos have now taken for granted that after dropping a couple of g's at the tables, customers will not mind paying $45 for a buffet dinner that is a bit so-so... Wynn, I'm looking at you!So if you REALLY want to eat somewhere on the Strip and you pass on my two places in my other reviews La Scala and Ichiza, then this place will deliver.  Also, you can make reservations here via OpenTable.com."
45,I went here while on vacation and had a wonderful experience here! The atmosphere is great and the dining was fantastic! I definitely recommend it!
46,"This is a chain so I've been to more than one, but always a pleasant meal.Some things are a bit rich/creamy (it's French!), but everything tastes great. Decent cheese plate and all the salads are gooooooooood.They have a pretty good wine selection, and a full bar for cocktails.Every time I've been to this location has been the best because I'm with my girlfriends that I don't see everyday, so that's a perk, but I would recommend it none the less. PS, leave the kids at home."
47,"This was my third time eating here over the past seven years or so, and I've always ordered the same thing:  The Steak Frites with Brandy Peppercorn Sauce.  It's a Top Sirloin, pounded very thin, but still very tender, and the sauce is wonderful.  My only quibble is that they've changed the style of their frites (again) and no longer have the shoestrings.  The new frites are so crisp they've not so good for dipping in the excess peppercorn sauce (half the fun).Unlike me, my wife ordered the Filet Mignon with Merlot Butter, Rare.  Normally I like my steak medium rare (this this was really, really rare), but I tried a bite and it was hands-down the most tender piece of beef I can ever remember tasting.  Almost like perfect, seared ahi tuna.  Wow.  I also learned that you can order any of their steaks with any of the sauces.  So next time, I'll probably mix and match with the Filet.All in all, one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  Excellent service and extensive wine list, too.  So why only 4 stars?  Well, I miss the shoestring frites -- a lot.  That's probably only worth a 1/2 star deduction, but Yelp doesn't do 1/2's."
48,"I love French Food and having lived in France for numerous years makes me very particular.I enjoyed Mon Ami Gabi very much.  The food is not the ""over the top"" French fare of many LV restos but rather a more comfortable bistro fare (think steak frites, mussels, roasted chicken, etc).My pate was quite good and came with pearl onions, cornichons, and grilled baguette toast.  The toast wasn't quite grilled enough for my liking, and they took care of this issue very quickly.  Otherwise the rest of our food was excellent as was the chocolate cake dessert.I would recommend reservations if you want to eat... we lucked out and got a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains.  Otherwise come prepared to wait in line for a patio seat.The bar area is very cozy, and the bartender made us a few stiff drinks while we waited on our table.  The wine list is very small but very high in quality.  The prices are very reasonable."
49,"This is a cute little french bistro in the Paris hotel.  Unlike the Eiffel tower restaurant, which serves fancy french food, this is more down home french cooking, the type of stuff you find in a Parisian sidewalk cafe.Their steak frites were really excellent, and was the standout for me. The service was very friendly and professional, and I was even able to get a nice table just walking in around dinnertime.  Even more amazing was how affordable this place was given the city-wide tourist trap that is Vegas.  I would definitely come back here again."
50,"For a business trip I planned a group dinner for about 15 colleagues, and put the word out to our Vegas office for recommendations. The head wrote back immediately recommending M-A-G, and got the ball rolling for me. Eventually for a party of 10 we had a private room, our own server and sommelier. The staff invited us over early to check out the personalized menu, wine list, and to see the room.Thanks to the advance planning, everything was smooth as butter. We had people coming and going all through the meal, and the servers didn't bat an eyelash. Thanks to our local office, we also got a lower minimum for the reserved room, which was a really nice touch, and even though we were inside we had a perfect view of the fountains. If you need to get a group meal going, this is a great place to do it. The private rooms accommodate a good number of guests, so chances are M-A-G will work. And I haven't really mentioned the food, but it was great across the board. Everyone was happy, no complaints--I think that says it all!"
51,"Enjoy authentic French Bistro Cuisine while you watch the Belogio Water Show from the Terrace of my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  There is ample outdoor seating and a great wine list to chose from.  A great place to dine before you catch a show at the Paris or go shopping at the Forum shops.  If you only have one chance to eat out in Las Vegas and you enjoy French Bistro dining, make sure you come to Mon Ami Gabi.  They take reservations and you may need them especially for dinner."
52,"Great view of the Bellagio fountain, great crepe, great bread, service...etcDon't leave Vegas without brunch here at some point."
53,"I dined here for the 2nd time on August 14th, 2007. I have to say that I wasn't looking forward to coming here as the 1st time I ate here a couple years ago I didn't think the food was that great nor the service. However, I'm so glad I came back because I enjoyed it more the 2nd time for two main reasons: our waiter was fantastic and I ordered a better dish. I had the skate with crispy garlic chips, vegetable salsa and caper lemon butter. It was absolutely amazing that I finished it all! Their fries and cocktails were also great! Prices are reasonable and they did a great job servicing our group of 9 girls."
54,"I went to Las Vegas to celebrate a girlfriend's birthday, and it was a very memorable experience.  After putting a request in for the patio at 8:15PM, we were seated by 8:45 -- on a Saturday night!  We had everything from appetizers, a bottle of wine, entrees, two desserts and coffee all around.  For five people it came out to a total of $314 with tip.  Not bad considering we got to sit outside on the patio and enjoyed the Bellagio hotel fountain show.  I had the Fillet Mignon with Merlot butter, but made the mistake of switching out the frites for mashed potatoes, which wasn't very flavorful.  I wish our waiter had told us that they are known for their frites!  We did experience one pissy server but all in all it was a great experience and will go back again.  At one point I found myself getting caught up in the moment and almost forgot I was in Las Vegas.  I was soaking in the ambiance, people walking on the sidewalk in front of us, and the beautiful music and water show from across the street, when a truck drove by pulling a picture of a half naked lady for some nudey show.  Ahh Vegas -- you gotta love it."
55,"I'm glad I decided on this one as my last dinner in Vegas, because it was an incredible experience!The atmosphere was dark and sophisticated, but it wasn't uptight either. I saw some people wearing casual clothes...hell, I was wearing a polo shirt and jeans and no one seemed to mind. I initially had the impression that it would be a fine dining experience, but it certainly wasn't the case. I always order steak so I decided to give their pork loin a try. It tasted wonderful, but unfortunately mine was cooked to the point of it being dry. I like my pork well done, but just because it's well done doesn't mean it has to be dry. Towards the end of my meal I was struggling to chew one more bite of the pork just because its dryness. The price for dinner was pretty hefty considering it wasn't a fine-dining restaurant, but I thought it was worth it for the experience to eat in front of the dancing waterfall at the Bellagio."
56,"I went for a relaxing lazy sunday lunch... French Onion Soup = SOOOO YUMMMMMMMMMMMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The cheese was just burnt enough, the broth not too oniony and not too salty.  Truly perfect.He got the Brie Burger = SO YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!Mon Ami Gabi gets one notch down because I shamefully got the spinach crepe. Silly girl you can get a crepe on the street, you get something YUMMY at Mon Ami Gabi.  Plus, our waiter was too busy chatting up a table of cougars to check up on us.Next time we are getting two soups and splitting that heavenly brie burger so that we have room for dessert. MMMM"
57,"This is the second time we brunch here on Sunday and we have never been disappointed.  The food is excellent there is no other way to put it.  I had a go at the ""make your own bloody mary"" bar, what a concept.  Loved it.  I would go with five stars, however the service was poor.  Had a great view of the fountains of Bellagio and an excellent place to people watch.  The patio was a bit hot but the view was great."
58,"I mostly appreciated the outdoor dining experience. I am French and that's something that I miss here in the US. The terrace has a very nice view on the Bellagio water show, the service was impeccable. The food was good enough for me although a little pricey for the quality."
59,"As a big French nut, obviously the Paris casino was a stop on my most recent trip to Vegas. My friend and I were looking to eat lunch and decided to try this place out-- very glad we did!While you sit outside (we even stayed there despite a rain shower), you can watch the Bellagio's water show and people watch, but you're also just high enough above sidewalk level that you don't feel trampled and it's not too noisy. My sandwich was PHENOMENAL and even though we had to wait awhile, our waitress was forthcoming in letting us know my friend's dish was accidentally burnt. We were apologized to and given some very delicious coffee on the house.Surprisingly reasonably priced-- we had expected to pay more-- and very yummy."
60,"Mon Ami Gabi is a wonderful bistro/steak house located in the Paris hotel and we do not leave Vegas until we dine here. Sit outside and dine al fresco, you will have a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains and it's fun to people watch. It's a bistro, you can dress casual and no one will judge you.There is an excellent wine list, of course! The St. Aubyn pinot is lovely. The service is courteous and prompt to see to your needs and you will not feel at all rushed. There are great cocktails on the menu, I tend to go straight for the wine, though.I like to start with the Onion Soup au Gratin, the 'french onion soup', you can taste so many layers of flavor and the cheese is melted on top, just starting to get that golden crust. YUM. I will have to make a point of trying other things on the menu, I can't seem to get past the Steak Bordelaise with it's lovely wine sauce and the soft, sweet, caramelized onions, or the filet mignon au poivre, always with frites, bien sur. Excellent steaks, I'm almost speechless...but not quite, there's still dessert! (And NO, I'm not sharing, get your own!).The creme brulee is excruciatingly delicious, it hurts so bad...The bananas foster crepes are tender and delicious and absolutely decadent. The chocolate mousse is pure decadence!I can't wait until our next trip, hopefully I can update this review...and add another dish to my list. Sigh...lovely..."
61,"J'adore Mon Ami Gabi! I've made it a point to visit this place more than once on my many trips to Vegas. Granted, I visit it when I'm on my more mellow trips, for example: with the bf's parents or when on a conference. I do not go here when I'm on bachelorette party trips or trips with 10 of my friends. It's right across from the Bellagio, so depending on your seating, you can see the awesome fountain shows and taken in Pavorotti's voice while you sip le vin. For dinner I had the Steak au Poivre with brandy peppercorn sauce and awesome fries. Another time I went for lunch and had the Creamy Chicken & Mushroom Crpe, which was tres excellent! It came with a spring salade and was large and delicious. Wine list was great - at lunch time they had a wine cart so you could see the bottles and take a taste if desired. Dessert - my friend got the Bananas Foster Crepe - he LOVES it. It's not my cup of tea, but if you enjoy bananas foster, you might like this!Note: I just looked on the website and I guess it's a chain - didn't know this!"
62,"I went to this restaurant by myself and was about to be seated in a table in a corner with no view. I promptly requested another table. After I got a better table, I sat down and promptly served with a warm mini baguette with whipped warm butter. I was happy. This is a restaurant who's smart to WARM their butter. Honestly, why do some restaurants serve chilled, cold butter I do not understand, particularly those who serve cold butter with room temperature bread. Why? Anyway, back to the bread. Starving, I broke part of the baguette and smeared it with butter. Oh my God.. when you're hungry, eating a warm baguette that's crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, smeared with warm whipped butter is to die for. My mouth was so happy. The waitstaff put a small pat of minced garlic for the bread but I prefer sugar with my bread and butter. Haven't tried the bread-butter-sugar yet? Try it. It's very good. The sugar needs to be the refined, regular sugar though. Sweet n low, Splenda and all the fake sugar crap won't cut it.Mm.. mmm. I ordered the appetizer (melted cheese with marinara sauce with garlic toasted bread) and salad (roasted pear with bleu cheese, walnuts and mix of greens).The melted cheese was good, but I wished it was real cheese rather than cream cheese. The salad was superb. I was too full to order dessert even though I really wanted to try their banana foster. This restaurant has one of the best location in Las Vegas. Imagine dining on the terrace on a nice evening with the Bellagio waterworks in action. Next time I have to bring my dad here since he loves watching the Bellagio waterworks.Nice."
63,"Quite simply the best dining experience we have had in a long time. The wait for an outside table was a bit long considering it being a Monday night, but the ambiance made the food taste that much better. The filet mignon avec roquefort made me reconsider my latest vegetarian kick. The tarte tatin was not overwhelmingly sweet, ala Mrs smith apple pie special, yet it craved the dessert fix. A nearby couple gave us their remaining half drunken bottle of Deboeuf pinot Noir which was an added drunken surprise. If and when you come to Vegas and are not a proponent of low quality buffets or overpriced average hotel restaurant food, make your way to Gabi's for Vegas nouriture, frenchy style."
64,"I only ordered a steamed artichoke here, so I can't opine on the food (although I did steal a bite of my friend's club sandwich and it was delicious). Five stars for their bloody mary bar. Brilliant! The waiter brings you a glass of vodka over ice. You do the rest - the bloody mary bar offers both tomato juice and bloody mary mix, every single hot sauce manufacutured in the world, worcestershire sauce, horseradish, celery, pickled asparagus, pickled onions, olives (you can also ask them to bring you blue cheese stuffed olives). It was the perfect way to end our Vegas weekend (well, winning back the money I lost in blackjack would have been perfect, but this was close enough). We went on a Sunday, so not sure if the bloody mary bar is a Sunday brunch offering only, or whether it's there all the time. We sat outside, which offers a great view of Bellagio's fountain show, as well as excellent people watching (love what people can get away with (not) wearing in Vegas!)"
65,"I gave this place 3 stars based on the following:- their french onion soup is delicious and one of my favorites- i hate to say this but... Left Bank and Costco make a juicier and flavorful roast chicken... ours was so dry it could mop up the glass of wine we spilled.  hahaha.- they served a box of popcorn to each table. what the hell???  so weird.  i didn't get it.  does anyone know the logic behind this?- be specific about where you'd like to sit, otherwise they'll put you in a random spot with the foot traffic of waitstaff and patrons circling around you like a swarm of bees.  i prefer the solarium-type room or patio seating to the dark, cavelike atmosphere of the interior rooms.- hostesses are pretentious (this is pretty funny)- the waitstaff are pleasant.- it's a fun place to have a meal and watch the fountain show at Bellagio.- again, the french onion soup is quite tasty.  :)- these guys close waaaay to early."
66,"Whenever I'm in Las Vegas I always, always try to hit this place. This place is part bistro and part fancy schamncy restaurant. Now if you can get a table at the outside patio with a view of the Bellagio, that's pretty nice. That's where it feels like a fancy restaurant. But inside it's dimly lit, intimate, feels like a second dining room; and that's the bistro feeling.Look to spend about $30 to $50 a person. Expensive, yes. But SOOO worth it. If you're going to eat at a place like Mon Ami Gabi, you MUST eat everything, meaning every course...appetizers , entree and dessert. Plus some wine, and you are set. Now what I usually order every time I'm here is that I start with the house Merlot. Then for my appetizer, I go for the crab cakes, there are only 2 of them but they taste really good. Then my main course would be the Filet Mignon, medium well. Awesome and they serve it with pomme frites (French fries). Altogether I am in heaven, pure heaven. I usually variate what my dessert would be I think I usually get the strawberry crepe or the sorbet.Now getting a table here can be difficult. I usually call four hours before my dinner time, meaning I reserve a table. But usually before 7pm, you should be able to get a table. I think it gets crazy at sundown and everyone wants a table at night to watch the fountain show at Bellagio.For me its the perfect place to eat. It doesn't try to hard to be the best or the prettiest. It just does what it should, serve great food, give great service, have a great atmosphere and cook a great steak!"
67,"Ooh, la, la Mon Ami Gabi.  Merci, for a yummilicious dinner last night.  I made a last minute dinner reservation for 9:15, we showed up at 8:45 and they were able to squeeze us in.  I was hoping that I could make a reservation on the patio, but it's first-come first serve, and I was not willing to wait for 2 hours.  They seated us at an indoor table right next the window, so that we could still see the Bellagio fountains.  The server brought out some couscous, compliments of the chef, and freshly baked french bread and butter.  I feel a little guilty for having my boyfriend sitting across from me because I have to say that I was in love with the butter.  I ordered the house salad and my bf ordered the french onion soup.  I was really surprised by their large portions because I was expecting it to be smaller.  Then our entrees came, I got the steak au pouvre and the bf got the steak with onions.  My heart was all aflutter when I saw what was on my plate.  A large platter which was half covered with a thin steak and frites.  The steak was flavorful and cooked to a perfect medium.  The frites were amazing, like strips of freshly cooked potato chips.  So like total gluttons, we inhaled our dinner.  As for dessert, we couldn't do it, we had eaten too much.  What made my bf very happy, which I think any water drinker would appreciate, was that his water glass was always filled without ever having to search for someone to refill it.  I can't wait to actually go back for dessert."
68,"3.5 stars.  3 stars really, but the frites gave it an extra .5 stars.I decided to book Mon Ami Gabi on open table after reading yelp - I really wanted the Patio seating. Not to mention that a month ago or so, Christine T. sent me some suggestions on where to have our 2 year anniv dinner  (my db is her BIL),  some of the suggestions were French Bistro/Steakhouses (i.e. Clementine in SF, etc). Instead of celebrating our 2 yr in SF, my bf took me to Las Vegas. We had 7PM reservations and we were seated immediately (It was really windy out and I decided to skip the patio seating). However, i wasn't very happy where we were seated. We were in the bar section in a little itsy bitsy corner table. I was very uncomfortable sitting there! I felt the table size was perfect for happy hour and appetizers, but not for a full dinner.  I complained a little bit to my db ""Are you sure you want to sit here?""  - repeat that at least 3x.  He's not much of a complainer, so he said our table was fine.  I really couldn't understand why we were seated in this ITSY bitsy table,  when there were TONS of empty tables..even in the main dining room!  Did I mention my feet were all retarded cuz I couldn't sit straight? I had my feet over to the side, but I sucked it up.  Did I mention we were seated really close to the other table? I felt like we made the 2 gentlemen next to us a little uncomfortable. They probably thought the same thing ""Why did they seat this couple over here - there are tons of empty tables!""We ordered crab cakes to share - I just found it OK. I still prefer the crabcakes at Kincaids - may be I'm just used to them, but the portion was generous - I give them that.  I ordered the Filet Mignon with red wine sauce. I thought the sauce was delicious, but I was a little disappointed with my filet. I had ordered it medium rare, yet it came crunchy on the outside (Is it supposed to be like that?) At other steak places, my filet cuts like butter, this one I had to put some effort - again, is it supposed to be like that? The frites were yummalcious!! My bf couldn't stop saying how much he loved them. LOL   My db ordered the steak with blue cheese and he did question it a few times, ""Is this over cooked? This doesn't look medium rare?"" Nonetheless, he ate it all. But, he's known to do that.  :)I decided to skip the wine since we've been up since 4am and we had a 1030P O show to watch. I didn't want to fall asleep. LOL.Service was excellent and attentive, prices were reasonable for a steakhouse.  Not sure if I'll be running back soon - there are TONS of other restaurants to try out in Vegas."
69,"I love this place!  This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I try to have dinner here whenever I'm in Vegas.The patio is one of the best on on the strip, right across from the Bellagio fountains.  The interior is dark, but very inviting.The steak frites are excellent.This is a great place to go for a romantic dinner or even a night out with the guys/girls."
70,"We arrived for brunch on a windy, chilly September morning, but stuck it out on the patio.  The brunch menu is just the lunch menu, so don't juggle your plans to be here at brunch.  Go somewhere else.  Enjoy Mon Ami Gabi any other time!  The waiter brought out a baguette with soft butter and yummy raspberry jam.  I usually do not eat jam but this was so good with the butter and soft, crusty bread.  I had a bloody mary, (or two!) it was good.  I heard raves about the bloody mary bar on here, but it is nothing special unless you are sitting right by it.  I would rather the waiter just bring out my drink.We were warmed up by the tomato soup (yum) and french onion soup (yummier).  Also got the appetizer of baked tomato and cheese with toasts.  I thought it would be literally sliced tomato with melted sliced cheese on top.  It was actually a tomato puree with goat cheese.  Very good, but not expected, as we already had the tomato soup.The quiche Lorraine was horrible.  There was an ingredient in there I couldn't stand, and my Mom disliked it, too.  That is not to say someone else would not like it, just not for me.  I got the chicken and brie sandwich, very good, as were the frites that came with it.  The best was the creamy chicken and mushroom crepe.  That also came with a salad with frisee and I think baby arugula with a tantalizing dressing... I wasn't sure what it was and forgot to ask our server.  Champagne vinegar, perhaps?I would definitely go back, though, and get the soup and the crepe.  I would also like to try the salad with pear & walnuts and the chocolate mousse."
71,"One of my favorites!  Great view, great food, great friendly service and the price is great!Great View - Right across the street from the Bellagio water show.  Just ask to be seated outside.  There are also a lot of overweight birds asking for food.  They will eat out of your handGreat Food - Can't complain.  I love their burgers.  They are literally like 5lbs and the fries are unique.  Very flat and very good.Great Service - Very friendly and professional.  A Class.Great Price - To top it all off, the price is not bad.  It's like $10 for a burger, but definitely feels like we got our moneys worth.Note : They don't allow sleeveless shirts or swim suits apparently.  I don't mind girls in swim suits but seriously who walks into a restaurant in the middle of the strip in a swim suit."
72,"Yeah, I know it's owned by a mega-restaurant group. Hell, I used to work for Lettuce Entertain You. And, yeah, there are 4 of these restaurants spread out across the country. But, dammit, as much as I wanted to have a problem with this place, I just don't.My meal was fantastic. I went with a classic Steak au Poivre, and it was absolutely delicious. Now, yeah, there is a better one out there, but for the price (expensive but reasonably so), this one is hard to beat.Plus, when you include the surroundings, this is a real winner.Definitely call ahead for reservations, or you'll be hungry for longer than you'd like to be.Generally, I'm pretty hard to please when it comes to chains, but Mon Ami Gabi is definitely a winner."
73,"It's a good thing we made reservations!  This place was packed on a Sunday brunch.  The place we were sitting had a view of the Bellagio water show.  What a way to wake up.The food was excellent.  I got to try their crab cakes. Although the crab was good, the salad that goes with it was excellent.  Now, I could have had the crepes, which are great, but I was in the mood for frites, which is like a combination of a french fry and chips.  Basically, I think they cut the potato in to thin slice french fry shapes.  Then they do a quick fry to it.Anyway, I ordered the fish and chips.  Now, normally when you think fish and chips, you think of getting five or six fish pieces,  like chicken tender shapes and all.  But not this place.  They give you a whole fillet of fish that is wrapped with panko bread and fried.  The fillet was at least a foot long.  That is a lot of fish!With some champagne on the side, this was a great brunch and a great way to say goodbye to sin city."
74,"It was really really good, the only gripe I had was it was very poorly lit... I guess a more romantic setting but I was not in the Romancing mood... wait staff was extremely good & food was great, some how they did not WOW me... will go again"
75,"Mon Ami Gabi is cute.  I love Paris, the *real* Paris and by extension I love the Paris hotel.  It was my first time eating at Mon Ami Gabi and it was good, but not fabulous.  I had the chopped salad, so I can't expect a lot from a salad, but I also tried the special soup and my friends mussels and still, the food was just OK. The location is perfect and the service is very good."
76,"Probably the best meal we had in Vegas over Thanksgiving weekend. If the weather permits, sit out on the patio and go for dinner! You have a spectacular view of the dancing waters at the Bellagio - great ambiance and fun! We started with the Baked Cheese and Tomato appetizer that was amazingly good! The bread that they serve throughout dinner is also really yummy! The boys also had the escargot that they enjoyed. For dinner I had the Butter Lettuce Salad that was fresh with a great dressing. I also had the yukon gold potato soup with brie which was delicious and very filling. My boyfriend had the Beef Wellington which he liked and my parents had the Steak Roquefort that they absolutely loved. Very tender and well prepared. And the frites that were served with it were yummy, also. Our best bang for our buck on our trip!"
77,"This is one of those few restaurants in Vegas that are not insanely expensive and in which you can feel like you're in a real restaurant and not in a restaurant that is an extension of a casino (however, the slots are not far away!).  The waitstaff is very good and very quick.  The drinks are phenomenal and the few times I've gone, the bartender was super friendly and hilariously charming (hard to do when you're dealing with so many tourists!).  The food is excellent and portions are fairly generous.  I've only been there for lunches, but I imagine the food is evening better in the evening.  I've tried the chicken, mushroom, and vegie crepe and so far it's my favorite.  Their steamed artichokes are delicious as well.  I highly recommend sitting outside on the patio that overlooks the Bellagio fountains, provided it's not 107 outside!"
78,"Just OK.Yes, it's affordable for the Strip, but I wasn't blown away by any means.  We were upstairs at one of the private rooms, which did have a nice view of the casino floor.  Service was just fair--they seemed bewildered when I didn't want the creme brulee and asked for a fruit cup instead.  What's the prob?"
79,"I had lunch here one time and was disappointed.  I had the steak sandwich with fries.  the sandwich wasn't filling and didn't taste as good as i hoped. All the fries were small, burnt and crunchy, like the ones u get at the bottom of a McDonald's bag.  and when i asked for ranch the server looked at me like i was crazy and said they don't serve ranch.  I'm sure they have better food and maybe one day I'll go back and find out."
80,"This can be a stunning meal if you happen to snag a table on the patio across from the Bellagio lake. If you're not able to do that, you're probably just as well off at any number of French bistros on the Strip.The food was good, but not particularly memorable. I ordered the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin which was OK, and noshed on country pate and cornichons (a must do whenever I eat French). Our server was pretty good, but since it was busy we hardly saw  much of her.  She was prompt when we saw her, but 10-15 minutes would go by before we would see her again.It was a scorcher of a September day, but a patio table, a fountain show at Bellagio, some cabernet, pate and cornichons - I was a happy camper. I would go back, perhaps if just for wine, pate and cornichons."
81,"I used to live a few blocks from the original Mon Ami Gabi on Lincoln Park West in Chicago, but I never went, only because it looked overly expensive.  However, leave it to me to dine there for the first time in Vegas.  The prices are actually very reasonable.  I had the french onion soup to start, which is almost a meal in itself.  I recommend it.  I had the steak au poivre with brandy peppercorn sauce which was decent but if I go back, I'll have to try the filet mignon with merlot butter, which is supposed to be their signature steak.  The sides were good, I recommend the garlic spinach.  They also have a pretty expansive wine list, which is a must for a french steakhouse.  The only downside was that they were out of a lot of dishes, including the dessert that we wanted!  We had an 8:15 reservation, so they shouldn't be running out of things that early on."
82,"I love this restaurant!!  HUGE portion sizes, I recommend sharing an entree plate rather than ordering individual plates.  The fresh french bread is delicious with the room temp butter.  it just melts in your mouth.  Skip the escargots..the dressing on it was to overwhelming.  I ordered a yummy roast chix. and my BF ordered the steak bordelaise; it was great up until you have a bite with the carmalized onions....so if you order this, request for no onions."
83,"The food was very satisfying; like French comfort food. My fiance and I both had the French onion soup. It was tasty, cheesy and oniony. I can never resist it once I see it on the menu. Unfortunately, we didn't get the bread until we were nearly done with our soup. I wasn't that hungry so for my entree I had the salad with apples, walnuts and cheese. The entire bottom of the plate is covered in cheese slices, there is approximately one walnut and quite a few thinly sliced apples. It was good but the smells from across the table left me wanting to steal my fiance's seared salmon with lemon butter sauce over orzo. They have rolling carts that hold all opened wines you can buy a glass of. One of them was parked right next to me and I was very tempted to help myself to a refill!"
84,"Food: The rest of my group didn't love their food here, but I thought my roast chicken with frites was delicious! The chicken was nice and moist and the frites were great to munch on! The bread before our meal was also great, fresh out of the oven.Price: Not bad at all. My meal was around $25 or so...most dishes were $40 and under. Service: Service here was good. Our server was friendly and took care of us.Atmosphere: Nice and intimate. You can also dine ouside right across from the Bellagio fountains. I liked dining inside though, it was nice and warm.Location: Located in Paris right in front."
85,"Four stars?!?  C'mon people.We ate here for lunch, right at the hottest point of the day.  It would have been a much nicer atmosphere if there were misters or something to cool me down, cause it was hot as a mofo out there!  It was so hot that our butter melted completely in 5 minutes.  I think this would be the only time I would ever prefer chilled butter over room temperature. We thought about sitting inside to escape the heat, but it was dark and depressing in the main dining room.We started off with the mussels, which I liked after having one bite but with every bite I continued to take, they just kept getting worse and worse.  I had to quit after 3 bites because they became way to salty for my liking.  Also, there were about 3 unopened mussels, which is grounds for send-back...but I decided to go easy on them, until my entree that is.For my main dish, I chose the seared salmon with a lemon butter sauce over orzo.  It was so bland and tasteless, I sent that bitch ass dish back.  The description on the menu made it sound so good,  and I was looking forward to that orzo, but it sucked in real life.  Sorry, but I have no pity for these huge casinos and I am expecting something not dissapointing when I'm dining at any one of them.  My bf liked his dish, though.  Maybe I chose the wrong thing, but I doubt I'll be giving them another chance to redeem themselves.The view of the Bellagio fountains was entertaining, which was a plus.  Also, its right on the strip so people watching is fun also.  Thats about it as far as the positives go for me.  Oh, and the bread was really good.  Eh, I'll give 'em 2.5."
86,Where can 2 dine on steak on the strip for less than $100? Mon Ami is one option. Food is solid.. particularly liked the frites. Atmosphere is awesome too. A great mid-range type place when you are looking for a nice dinner but don't want to drop hundreds.
87,"Cute little restaurant with plenty of patio seating. I would suggest getting a table outside around dusk to people watch and see the Bellagio fountain show across the street. Had fantastic Escargots here - it's an appetizer but can eat as a meal. They were very fresh and just popped in your mouth. Compared to the Eiffel Tower restaurant above it, this is a very casual place where you can just wander in and grab a table. Of course, during the dinner rush, you'll have to take a number and wait a bit."
88,"Soooo yummy. Been here a few times and definitely coming back. Eating here always leaves my taste buds and tummy excited and satisfied. Bonus points for being able to dine while watching the water shows across the street. Romantic, but a great place to hang out with friends as well."
89,Make reservations to sit outside near the front of the restaurant so you have a clear view of the Bellagio water fountain show. Order the quiche lorraine and blackberry currant ice tea. The pear salad is yummy too.
90,"Although we have one of these LEYE restaurants in Chicago, this spot in Vegas is particularly cool because of its prime piece of real estate.  There is no better place to sit in Vegas - outside in their outdoor patio, under the heated lamps, watching the dancing waters at the Bellagio fountain!  Great people watching spot as well.  And their food is great for a chain - I especially love getting appetizers and wine.  Their soups are delicious, and their entrees are good as well.  Great lunch place!"
91,"This has always been one of my favs in Vegas for a ""don't break your bank"" kinda dinner place. The best seat in the house is outside so you can see the Bellagio water show that goes on every 15 mins or so once it gets dark outside. In the winter, the heat lamps outside keep you company. In the summer, the misters do. Either which time of year you go, try to sit outside. The wait staff are all great, very friendly, efficient, attentive to your needs, Being a meat eater, I had the bleu cheese steak last time with french fries. I didn't talk for about 10 min cause I was busy chowing on my food. It just all tasted so freaking good! I have been here before and was happy to share this place with my 5 girl friends who now also love this place as much as I do!"
92,"Despite the faux-grandiosity that is Las Vegas, stellar restaurants that offer surprisingly solid menu items are abundant.  Mon Ami Gabi is a restaurant at the first floor of the Paris hotel.  Sitting in the indoor/outdoor patio allows the diner a front seat view of the Bellagio fountain show.  I adore French Bistros and I have to say, Mon Ami Gabi was surprisingly one of the better ones I have been to. Their standard bistro food was right on the money. Warm french bread, escargot, pomme frittes, french onion soup and several glasses of Roses - made for a great extended and lazy lunch.  This restaurant may not have been as ""charming"" and authentic as the French Bistros I have been to in San Francisco, Napa Valley or New York.  However, Mon Ami Gabi serves solid French Bistro food - a good alternative to indoor- buffet style restaurants on the strip."
93,My girlfriend and I were looking for a nice affordable restaurant on the strip and came across Mon Ami. We couldn't have chosen a better place! The food was excellent! I highly recommend the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin with potato puree. And the chicken liver pate sounds gross but was really good too! Try to get a patio seat so you can get a perfect view of the Bellagio water show. This place gets pretty packed so a reservation is recommended. J'aime mon ami Gabi!
94,"Loved it! Although it was kinda chilly to seat outside we didnt mind and it was worth it- very romantic overlooking the B's fountains. I had the crab cake apptz (yum!) and the Mac & Cheese (double yum), my husband had the salmon and he raved about it as well, no wine and the bill added up to aprox $60"
95,Great food. I ordered a filet mignon. The waiter was very attentive to us.
96,"This is a great brunch location. We chose not to sit outdoors since it was December and yes, it does get cold in Vegas, but indoors had a very nice decor as well. The sourdough they served before brunch was great, as was everything else we had (the three of us just shared off of each others plates). A great place to nurse a hangover (trust me).  :)"
97,"great burgers, decently priced restaurant for vegas. one of the few authentic cafes on the strip."
98,"I usually feel ripped off after I eat French food, but here, what you get is worth what you pay for. You can't go wrong with their steak. Service was good but it could have been friendlier.JONASAPPROVED!"
99,"After a disappointing experience at Onda the night before, we were hoping Mon Ami Gabi would live up to our expectations and it certainly did! We had a great dinner and would definitely go back next time we are in Vegas. We went with a group of 13 on a Saturday night and had 6 pm reservations. Our server was really nice and joked around with us. Plus the fact that at the end of the night he was willing to do seperate checks and split it anyway we wanted was really cool of him.My husband and I split the cheese plate for an appetizer...the St. Andre triple cream was by far my favorite of the three cheeses on the plate.  The Fleur de Marquis was OK and the blue cheese was probably my least favorite.  For dinner, I just had the crab cake appetizer. The crab cake was full of jumbo lump crabmeat and did not have much filler at all...in short, it was delicious.  The only part about the crab cake appetizer I did not like was the celery root remoulade.  I didn't care for the flavor and didn't feel that it complimented the crabcake well at all.  My husband had the seared sea scallops which he graciously let me try.  They were awesome...cooked perfectly as opposed to the disgusting ones I had at Onda the night before.  For dessert we had the chocolate mousse which was good and a perfect way to end the meal.My only real negative is that if you have to use the restroom, you have to leave the restaurant and go around the corner back near the sports book to the bathroom there."
100,"After driving 8+ hours to Las Vegas from Oakland I was, needless to say, exhausted and a little cranky. After checking into our hotel room we decided to check out the Paris casino. Then we got hungry. Then we waited about 20 minutes for a table on the patio. The hostesses were partially rude, but the rest of the night was so enjoyable I promptly forgot about their aloofness. The patio is awesome because you get a great view of the Bellagio fountain and, even more importantly, there are enough heat lamps!Our meals were delicious (flat iron steak and a sea bass special). The best thing about the sea bass, besides it tasting like heaven, was its substantial size. Normally fancy restaurants give you a fist sized serving, but not Mon Ami Gabi. My date's steak was nothing to scoff at, either. The wine our server suggested was very good and put me in a decidedly better mood than the one I sat down with. I would love to dine here again."
101,"The sad French bread and butter that they serve did not cut it for the price of this place. My Steak Bordelaise was over cooked. Some of my asparagus was old and dry. The Macaroni Au Gratin was pretty good and the location is perfect for the Bellagio water show, but all that still does not deserve any more than 3 stars."
102,"With all the overpriced french restaurants in the Paris Casino, Mon Ami Gabi is indeed a gem.  The food is thoroghly enjoyable, and I have not once felt like I've overpaid for anything.  I've been to this establishment three times, once for lunch and twice for dinner.  Let me talk about dinner. Lunch was great, but I don't remember anything about it :(  Dinner, my friends, is well worth it.  For one, I'm addicted to their ""c'est si bon"" martini (it's a bit overpriced...but it's absolutely delicious...what is it?  A watermelon martini, and it's fan-freaking-tastic!).  Now we get to why I adore dinner so much--it's that wondrous hot baguette that comes with a side of butter and slightly picked julienned carrots.  Oooh...I'm drooling. I could make a meal out of this and in fact, I did once.   Okay, I may be weird, but i'm obsessed with it.  I'm a sucker for their escargot.   How can I not be?  The sauce is scrumptious!  Butter, garlic, parsley AND I have this hot baguette!  W-O-W.  As for the entrees, I've had steak on both occassions--new york strip the first time and the ribeye special they had that night.  Needless to say, I enjoyed it very much...it's not going to be the same cute you get from 555 east or Mortons, but it's delicious nonetheless.  And the pomme frites? Spectacular!  The cut is just great.  I've also been equally happy with their desserts. I'm a sucker for creme brulee, and I'll even happily enjoy the most mediocre of creme brulees.  I would have to say that my favorite desserts are the crepes and the tarte tartin (rustic apple tart) a la mode. Divine!  I have a sweet tooth.  As far as customer service goes, I have absolutely complaints--with the exception of feeling a bit embarassed by the incredulous looks I get from devouring a loaf of bread and carrots."
103,"During the height of the ""Bennifer"" madness, back in 2002, I was having dinner here with my family and SHE came in to eat. It was neat watching the buzz spread around the restaurant, seeing the waitstaff all whispering, and then her being whisked into the patio room. Ahh memories. Well, the food was good then and it's still good. We have a Mon Ami Gabi in Chicago, but my husband and I had a $25 gift card and were trying to stay under budget in Vegas so we decided to come here anyway.Where else can you get an awesome perfectly-cooked (medium rare) hangar steak with MERLOT butter (yumm) for under $20----wait, what!? Oh it's $10 more in Vegas. Since we were there for brunch anyways, we decided to skip the big steak. We still got the steamed artichoke (excellent as always) and tried the potato and brie soup. The soup was awesome! We also had the eggs benedict on steak which was really tasty, if a bit overcooked. The steak was really thin so it came out pretty well done. We also indulged in the blueberry sage martini which was fantastic. 3 drinks and all that food ended up at about $70. Not too bad for Vegas."
104,"Oh my god!  This is one of the best places I've experienced in Las Vegas.  The outside seating has a great view of the Bellagio water show and was pleasant to sit in even during a slightly cool night in February.  The bread and carrot salad was great and our waitress was phenomenal with a cute accent.  The food was also good and the Bananas Foster Crepe was delicious, a shame I had to share with two coworkers."
105,"Great Vegas Pick. Great menu and wine list, perfect location overlooking the Bellagio Water show, and awesome service. Butter Lettuce Salad was simple and good, Steak and Frites were Trs dlicieux. Fun, romantic and would definitley come back."
106,"Voulez vouz monge avec moi!!!!  Came to this place on a Sat afternoon and ate in the patio area.  Ordered the blueberry french toast...cant account for what everyone else in our party ate.  Hands down the best french toast I've ever had in my life.  Mind you, FT is my fav breakfast item and I've been to Paris France twice!   Great view plus great food equals 4 stars."
107,"I went here with my girlfriend for lunch back in October '07.  I had the absolute BEST steak sandwich I have ever had in my entire life!  It basically melted in your mouth - so moist and juicy!  Simply amazing.  Unfortunately, I cannot speak about the dinner service as we only had lunch, but I would highly recommend having lunch and a couple beers and watching the fountains at Bellagio."
108,"I got tired of the buffet breakfasts at the casinos, so i tried Mon Ami.  it was good, solid, fresh food.  Not the best breakfast i've ever had, mind you, but the location is great--get the patio seats and you can enjoy the fountain show at Bellagio, and service is great.  good to just sit and chill and people watch for an hour or so before heading back to the blackjack tables."
109,"I'd pay for the patio seating even if the food were not good. It was not gourmet by any means (but hey I'm from SF and we have some of the best, freshest food around). The steak was cooked well, but wasn't as tasty as I had hoped. The service was attentive but both of the wines he recommended were crap. But maybe all the wine was crap. We quit after two.the whiskey cocktail I had was great tho and the cappuccino was a perfect end to our meal."
110,"After waking up at noon and missing brunch buffet, we decided to go to this quaint little French cafe inside Paris. We had a nice dinner at Picasso that night so we didn't want to be too full, so we got there around 1, but the service was SO slow and we didn't get our food and finish eating until almost 3 PM. I think we finally got out of the place around 3:30 and by then, we had to go back to our hotel to change and stuff. I think we waited literally 20 minutes for our check because the waiter loves to chat it up with all the other tables. The actual food was decent. I think I had the Gruyere cheese, bacon and, onion burger, which was pretty good. The ""frites"" (fries) were kind of weird because they were like regular fries but squashed flat and then refried. A little too much. Also tried some chicken B.L.T and steak sandwich with caramelized onions, which were decent. I think the best  thing I tried was the Steak Bordelaise, which was really juicy and tender. Maybe we should have went for weekend brunch, which might have been better with some breakfast foods. Regardless, service needs to speed up a bit. It was somewhat French, but I don't think they were trying to imitate the carefree attitude of dining and taking your time in France."
111,"I decided to go to Mon Ami Gabi for my birthday with a party of 13.  I chose it was because it is moderately priced and I love French food.  I have to say I was quite pleased, there were a few snags but overall it was a good experience. The food was fantastic.  The escargot was great, very garlicky but I love garlic so I was fine with it!  My filet was cooked to medium rare perfection and was one of the best steaks I've had in a long time.  (Much better than the steak I had at N9NE) The wine we selected was fantastic, so good we ordered a second bottle.  The bananas fosters crepe was huge and my husband and I could not finish it.....it was that big! Overall I think it's a great dining experience on the strip if you want a good meal for your money.  W did have a large party and I found MAG to be as accommodating as possible, even seating us even though the whole party wasn't present.  While our server was attentive however, my husband received his steak au poivre, not what he ordered, but still great all the same."
112,"wonderful food and atmosphere. spotted joey slotnick while having lunch! (nip/tuck fan) service is amazing. word to the wise, make reservations. don't expect some champs elyses restaurant and you'll be ok."
113,*sssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhh*i'm effing melting into my brie burger.
114,"We sought out a lunch place for after our Vegas arrival so we thought the view and food of Mon Ami Gabi would be a nice way to start the weekend. For the most part it was. We were told that if we wanted to get started now we could sit we could sit inside or wait 30 mins and sit outside. We were hungry so screw it we'll sit inside...we walked..and walked...and walked and found ourselves outside much to our surprise! So we were in the covered patio. Perfect - just barely under the awning, avoiding the scorching Sun. This is definitely a place to be seen...especially if your penchant for attention-whoredom is working on whatever day you're there.The service here is pretty good - despite forgetting a beer that got hidden behind several other drinks, our waitress was very knowledgeable about the wine selections and even let me taste before deciding. I think that deserves some merit. Their wine of the week was a Layercake Cotes-du-Rhone. Apparently the wine maker came from Barossa valley in Australia but started a vineyard in France. Very good with the food.On to the food! Started with the butter lettuce salad with citrus vinaigrette. There is something that feels sophisticated about cutting your lettuce up rather than just constantly stabbing at veggies. My girl thought the dressing was too oily. I liked it and thought it was pretty good but nothing that would blow you away. It was a bit too warm for soup but the french onion soup looked as good as the Yelp reviews made it sound from looking at what others were ordering. For our main courses we shared sandwiches - they had a special which was a turkey sandwich with brie and orange marmalade. Sounded great so we got that. Everything was pretty good except the turkey. I thought it was a bit of a step up from butterball. It wasn't bad, but I thought they should put a bit more effort into that turkey.The Croque Monsieur here is AMAZING. Holy crap - I've had these several times before...maybe at 4-5 different restaurants but this was far and away the best. The cheese gratinee on top was great - the ham was very flavorful. If you're in the mood for a sandwich you need to try this sandwich. They'll do it ""Madame"" style if you prefer as well.Great lunch spot - comparing it to something more local to me, like left bank, I'd say this appears to have much of the same appeal - (what is supposed) standard french fare with the to-be-expected American concessions. Definitely a relaxing, memorable experience."
115,This is hardly a great French restaurant.. I would say its mostly a tourist trap with mediocre food that is severely over priced for the quality. The service and view were decent enough but the food quality was pretty bad. Me and the Mr took his elderly Aunt and Uncle there so it was more about family then the food which in this case was a good thing.I still like the name though.. has a special ring to it!
116,"Until last night I had only been to Mon Ami Gabi for business lunches.  We'd sit on the patio overlooking the strip and I'd order good food, but be green with envy of all the people who were there just for the pleasure of it.  I adore my clients and enjoy their company very much, but lets face it, its not the same as a cozy, romatic dinner for two.I didn't get the romance last night, but did have dinner on the patio with another client, who I also consider a friend.  We got there around 6:30 and were seated on the patio after just a few minutes wait.  We apparently arrived just in time because it was packed.  Like other yelpers have mentioned, there's great people watching because you are literally sitting right above the strip.......and having the water fountains at Bellagio across the street adds to the ambience and uniqueness of being in Las Vegas.  Unfortunately we only got to see one show because the wind interferred.   But the wind (I'd call it more of a breeze) felt great and the weather was perfect.  We ordered a bottle of Sancerre, which always makes me happy, and it was the perfect wine to enjoy underneath the setting sun (hmmmmm, this does sound kind of romantic, doesn't it?).  For an appetizer, we ordered the steamed artichoke, which was very good with a lemon mayo for dipping and for dinner I had the scallops atop a cauliflower mash and spinach.  My friend had the skate, which was perfect too.  We also ordered a side of roasted beets, which is where the one slip up happened with us.  Our server forgot to bring it until we were pretty much through with dinner, so they didn't charge us for it.....and it was yummy. Finding a fabulous meal in Las Vegas is very easy.  Finding one that doesn't cost over $100 per person is not.  Our total dinner came out to around $150 including the wine and the tip.  What adds to this being such a great value is that it is one of the only places (that I know of) where you can sit outside right on Las Vegas Boulevard.  If you are in Las Vegas for vacation, then this will certainly enhance that feeling of being in the center of things.  There's Trader Vic's next door, but its a totally different vibe....more of a lounge/bar than a restaurant patio."
117,"This place gets an extra star just for their carrot spread alone! What the heck do they put in that stuff?? I wish you could just pay to go there and eat fresh baguette w/ butter and the carrot stuff.Took the BF here for an anniversary dinner, and while the service and food were both excellent, I honestly wish the whole experience had taken longer. We definitely weren't rushed or anything, but all our courses came out at lightning speed, and considering how fast we devoured all the frenchy goodness, we were only there for an hour or so. After being promptly seated for our dinner reservation, we started with the french onion soup. I'm not that much of a soup guy, but how can you eat at a French restaurant without ordering multiple courses, and ensuring that the majority include an alarming amount of cheese, butter, or other source of saturated fat?? There must have been about 5 lbs. of gruyere on that bad boy, but wow, was it delish. Next courses: trout grenoblaise (sp?) and filet mignon. The trout was the perfect portion, perfectly seasoned, and not too heavy, although I didn't care too much for the accompanying potatoes. BF's filet was decent, but the horseradish sauce on top really made it melt in your mouth. Up next: creme brulee. I don't think I've had enough creme brulee to discern the quality of this particular one, but BF said it was really good.Overall, a great place if you want to eat on the Strip while not going broke that offers great, but not amazing, fare. I really wish we had sat on the patio bc it's right across from the Bellagio fountains. If you go, take time to ENJOY your food and don't inhale it like voracious pigs. And don't fill up on the carrot slaw stuff, even though it's hard!"
118,"We really adore this place and have come back here a few times for lunch.  Especially a breezy sunny day, there's no restaurant I rather be than here and sit on the outdoor (or semi-outdoor covered) patio, enjoying their hot fresh baguette and their wonderful brie burger.  Everything we have tried here have been good and consistent.  Wonderful place for lunch."
119,"Yes this place is catered for tourists, but it's Las Vegas what do you expect?  The atmosphere was lovely and attentive service.  Went for lunch and promptly served French bread.  We said upfront we were just there for the dessert and had no problems with that.  Ordered Banana Foster ($8.50) which was huge and totally covered with caramel; too sweet for me but all I had to do was scrape off the excess caramel.  The Creme Brulee (about 8 bucks) was delicious... but someone posted a picture of it with a strawberry and we didn't get a strawberry =("
120,"This was my last boss's favorite restaurant in Las Vegas, and he took me there to show me why: great wine selection and delicious food.  Don't be fooled by the french name of the restaurant -- you can get an amazing steak here as well."
121,"Found this place on accident. I was looking for something to eat at 4:30 on a Sunday and most places were closed until 5PM. I was starving and couldn't wait, so  after trying nearly ever where in the Bellagio, I gave up and headed for the Strip.  I noticed a few people braving the 106 degree weather on the patio at Mon Ami and figured their must be a reason. The hostess was a little self involved, and initially tried to seat us outside, even though we requested an inside table. We compromised and settled for a table in the shade . I started with the Gazpacho, and my friend ordered the French Onion Soup. Both were tasty. The French Onion featured a  mountain of cheese, and the gazpacho was refreshing, with just a hint of basil. I went with the Bacon Wrapped pork tenderloin for dinner. What could be better than pork wrapped in pork? Seriously. It was good, if a little overdone for my taste. However, I did enjoy the potato puree and the Cherry Port sauce that accompianed it. My friend went with a Market tomato salad and the Crab Cake and Gribiche Sauce.  The tomatoes were fresh and delicious and the Crab Cake was excellent. I ordered a glass of the LaRouche Pinot Noir.  I think it suffered from setting on the rolling wine cart in the 106 degree heat.  Dessert was Bananas Foster and Creme Brulee. Both were delicious,  as was the coffee. Mon Ami is very reasonably priced for a restaurant on the Strip, and the food is good. I probably would have gone with three starts though if not for the excellent service provided by our amazingly hot waiter Matthew. Seriously. I am rarely ever speechless, but this one rendered me mute."
122,"I really wanted more for a $60 meal.  The restaurant is beautiful but you expect that in the nice hotels in Vegas.  Service was also nice and very attentive.  The mixed drinks were pretty tasty also.Now to the main purpose of a restaurant...the food.  Blah!  The French Onion Soup had so much cheese and almost no onion.  I don't think I can  express how much cheese....soooo much.  Too much.  For my entree, I had the seared sea scallops with whipped cauliflower and spinach.  The scallops were still raw and cold in the center and although there was a nice sear on them, the outside was cold too.  The cauliflower was more runny than whipped and the spinach was just okay.I gave up at dessert. Friends who did have dessert said it was good but nothing they couldn't have had somewhere else, cheaper."
123,"ehhh......a group of friends and I came here on our last morning before leaving Vegas.  I got the Gabi Chopped Salad with chicken and it really wasnt that good, especially for $15.  It sounded delish but ehh...  3 of my friends were in the mood for a really good crepe so they ordered the mushroom and chicken crepe.  They all hated it.  I took a bite and it was pretty nasty.  Someone else got the ham and cheese crepe and it was supposidly better than the mushroom crepe.  Another person got a burger but threw a fit because they didn't have American cheese.  The fit was stopped when he ordered a virgin pina colada and about died it was so good.  The last person ordered one of the steaks and frites and he really liked it.  They all said the frites were kind of weird though.I would give this place 2 stars but the 3rd star is from the build-your-own bloody mary. mmm it was delicious!!  you could add celery, pepper, bell peppers, onions, carrots..i forget what else but the bloody mary was great.   the veggies were actually pretty wilted and not very fresh though, but whatever."
124,"Excellent Filet Mignon with butter and red wine reduction.  I was very surprised at their signature fries which reminded me of a wide flat linguini shape fry that was crunchy and soft at the same time, extremely addicting.  The only thing that wasn't spectacular was the steamed artichoke which was very plain, but everything else was excellent!  Ratatouille, French Cut fresh steamed beans and of course the Creme Brulee!"
125,I loved the mussels and fries enough to come back here twice in one trip and sit on the deck looking out to the Bellagio Fountains. This was back in 2004. I still have fond memories of the place.
126,"I really don't think I've had a bad experience here. I keep coming back, despite the mediocre food, partially due to the relaxing environment this restaurant places you in.The allure of this restaurant is not just it's casual bistro-like food, but the view. The view is what sells people to come here. Nobody ever really sits far within the restaurant, everyone sits in the patio area. Bellagio fountain, front row seat, with good food and champagne in front of you. The life of a winner (or the consolation prize of the big loser - in my case).Came here for a nice Sunday brunch, and ordered relatively smaller dishes, partially since I was so weighed down with guilt of how much money I had lost the night before.Got myself a hearty French onion soup, and salmon rillettes.French onion soup was hearty, but salty. A huge amount of cheese (gruyere possibly, was not really paying too much attention). Good flavoring, solid dish.Salmon rillettes I may not get again. It was decent, but not transcendent. The cornichons with the salmon rillettes were well pickled, but something was just lacking with the rillettes. Not sure what.If anything, the best part are the fresh french baguettes that come out before hand with any dish. Warm warm baguettes, with raspberry jam, and good butter. Excellent stuff.Ordered a bottle of Perrier-Jouet Champagne Brut MV. Don't really scoff at this bottle, even though it is the cheapest one on their list. It's well worth the money, and reasonably priced (68$, vs ~40$ at BevMo, and more for others). Freaking awesome champagne - rated pretty highly as well. A definite must get, and makes you feel like an absolute high roller, even though you're rolling in the mud with your huge losses.4 stars - Inconsistent food, but excellent view and service, in addition to fresh baguettes, make up a great experience. You can just sit down, look towards the fountains, and sigh in relaxation."
127,"Come for the view, and stay for the... well, the view. The atmosphere is good especially on a breezy summer night, with the Bellagio water fountain show playing across the street. Service can be mixed, I've waiting for nearly 50 minutes for my food to arrive, and I've also had almost no wait.Definitely come here for the ambiance, especially in the evening. Food is not bad, but not memorable either."
128,"Good enough to go twice on my trip to Vegas.  I fell in love with the brie and spinach crepe and the cheese board appetizer.  Staff is also very knowledgeable about wine.Even on a 115 degree day, the patio is comfortable enough to eat on and it's really the only place in Vegas where you can eat outside on the Strip.  Great view of the Bellagio as well."
129,"Considering this is Vegas and almost every nicer sit-down restaurant is outrageous, Mon Ami Gabi is actually good and reasonable by Vegas standards.I went there with a group of 15 people for business dinner. It was a set menu with choices. First was a mixed green salad, next I had crab cake, next was filet mignon with the reduction and then the creme brulee.I was worried about the steak with the reviews on here, but it was excellent and cooked perfectly medium rare. Crab cake was good too. Simple mixed green salads are hard to ruin. Creme brulee size was generous but a bit cool. I prefer my cb to be slightly warm from the recent sugar glazing but flavor was fine. Service was very good. First dish took a long time and our party head discreetly asked them to speed it up a bit and the pace picked up.I would eat there again and this is versus getting dragged to Rain Forest Cafe tonight. Talk about overpriced and underwhelming! It wasn't my choice.Verdict: Vive la Strip restaurant that actually is reasonable and serves good food for less than $100/person."
130,"The Top 3 Vegas French restaurants on my list are: Alize, Fleur de Lys and Mon Ami Gabi.I go to Mon Ami Gabi at Paris for dinner just as much as I go to Taqueria Canonita at Venetian for lunch. Alize and Fleur de Lys I've only been to once, because they're more of a very special occasion type establishment (i.e. Valentine's Day dinner/wedding rehearsal dinner)Here's what we always order:Appetizers: Country Style Pt, Escargots de Bourgogne & Crab CakeSalads: Double Duck Leg Confit Salad &/ Steak Salad MaisonSoup: Onion Soup Au GratinEntrees: Filet Mignon Au Poivre, Seared Sea Scallops &/ SkateDessert: can't go wrong, just order what you feel likeAnd if the weather permits, ask for the outdoor seating in front of the Bellagio dancing water fountain. I also suggest asking the waiter to make suggestions for the right wine to go with your meal."
131,"Very good food and wine, friendly server, and a great view of the fountains at the Bellagio."
132,"Had a decent, affordable (for vegas)  dinner at Mon Ami Gabi. I had a craving for French Onion Soup (yes I know thats weird) which is why we came here. And their soup did not disappoint! It was cheesey, full flavored and amazing. I ordered the Steak Au Poivre avec Frites which was good, not as great as the soup but definitely still yummy. However the service was lacking. They took my soup away before I was done with it and without asking. I never received a steak knife even though I asked 3 times for one and my diet coke was never refilled which was also requested several times. Quel dommage!"
133,"There are a few things I must do each time I go to Vegas, and one of them is eat steak.  Bizarre, perhaps, but a lifelong tradition I have no interest in stopping any time soon.On my most recent trip, my friend and I were discussing which wonderful, carnivorous eatery to frequent.  I mentioned a couple of my long-time favorites, and she countered with Mon Ami Gabi.Her selling point was excellent steak on a budget.  Fair enough, I'm always up for trying something new.  We had a reservation and were seated promptly.  They let us choose between indoor or outdoor seating.  It was 10 million degrees outside (no exaggeration!) so we opted for inside.  The setting was quaint, very bistro-in-the-real-paris-with-much-higher-ceilings.  Our waiter was *awesome*.  He excelled at flirting 101, but not in an annoying way.We both ordered the steak frites.  The beef was good, the sauce (you get to choose one) was disappointing (I had the bordelaise) and I was glad I ordered it on the side.  My friend loved her mushroom sauce.  The fries were amazing.  Possibly the best ever.Other selling points: I wasn't in a wine mood, as I had already had a couple of drinks elsewhere before dinner, and our waiter poured me a glass on the house.  The carrot tapenade and baguette were fabulous.  There were nickel slots outside the front door.  Okay, nix the last one.To sum it up, good steak, good price, not my favorite in Vegas... but Daniel is now my favorite waiter in all of Nevada.Finally, I wish I could comment on dessert, but I was determined to have my Vegas cheesecake at Carnegie Deli after Crique de Soleil.  So no dessert was had."
134,This was probably the dining highlight of our entire Vegas vacation.  Our waiter Matthew was very friendly and brought with him some very enthusiastic suggestions.  These included:- The Scallop appetizer- The Filet Mignon with merlot wine sauce reduction - The New York Strip with a special mushroom sauce.- Off-menu creme brulee.He was bang on with every suggestion.... (especially that filet mignon-  the sauce was buttery ecstasy!) though the kitchen was out of the creme brulee necessities so he gave us a dessert of our choice and comped it.    We chose the bananas foster and would declare it a victory.  After a glass of madeira the bill came out to $100 plus tip and in Vegas I'd call it a darn good value.
135,"Rick and Ilsa may always have Paris,  but I'll always have Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris in Las Vegas.  Anyone who ever says they hate Vegas has obviously never spent an afternoon at this delightful French bistro.  What's not to love about Vegas sunshine, great company, fine wine, fantastic food, Andrea Bocelli singing ""Time to Say Goodbye"" as the fountains at the Bellagio seem to perform just for you.  I've now been three times -- it's a Vegas must -- and each time the food, service and atmosphere have yet to disappoint. While the Israeli quartet at the next table who chain smoked added a seemingly French touch, one should keep in mind that Las Vegas's no smoking ordinance only applies indoors.  That makes for a tough choice.  But the food is so good -- from the bread to the dessert  -- I'd sit just about anywhere to enjoy it. And you get a lot -- Mon Ami Gabi may be French food but it is not ""nouvelle cuisine"" of small portions and high prices, in fact the prices are quite reasonable.   I wish they were open later as I'd go three times  in one day if I could!"
136,"Mon Ami Gabi was, by far, our best dining experience on our weekend trip to Las Vegas.  We had a 7:00 reservation for Saturday night, so we had no problem being seated right away.  The decor was nice...nothing extravagant, but nice nonetheless.  I ordered the thyme-seared salmon with orzo, spinach, and lemon butter for $18.95.  My wife had the roast chicken & frites (grandmere style) with mushrooms, bacon & pearl onions for $18.95 as well. Both dinners were very good.  I would give mine an ""outstanding"" rating though.  Both dishes were a little salty, but it did add a lot of flavor to the dishes.  Dinner, tax, and tip for $60.00  We'll definitely de back on our next trip to Sin City!"
137,"We went here for dinner and opted to seat inside (the weather outside was an excruciating 112), turned out be an excellent choice. We were pleasantly surprised on how generous the servings were. For starters we had the escargots, we enjoyed it, although we never had escargots cooked that way before. We also both ordered steak frites which we both enjoyed. And the fries, the best we've had by far. So thin and crispy. We had tarte tatin for dessert, it was delicious but a little too sweet and by that time we hardly had room in our tummies anyway. Their mojito was also pretty good, strong and very minty. Our server was very nice, attentive, generous with the bread. Ambiance was also nice, cozy and romantic, depending where you sit. We will come back here and recommend to friends for sure."
138,"If 3.5 stars were an option this place would receive it.  Allow me to elaborate. The service was five stars. From the hostess to the bus boy to our waiter, everyone was friendly and accomodating. The food, however, gets two stars. This puts me in the position to round up or down, at a 3.5 average. Well folks, I just have to round down because dinner was $150 and not worth it. To start, we shared the baked shrimp. These were tasty, but to be honest you'd find something just as good at a mid range chain. For our entrees I had the filet, and my gorlfriend had the pork tenderloin medallions wrapped in bacon. The medallions were fantastic. Very tender, very flavorful, and accompanied by creamy but tato-rich mashed potatoes. That meal was worth it price, HOWEVER, my filet....oh my filet. Stringy, chewey, and bland are the first 3 adjectives that come to mind. I told the waiter that it was disappointing, to which he offered to take it off our bill. Very nice of him, but I would not necessitate that. He tried to explain that a filet cut was different, but  really, really it was Denny's quality, but with Denny's you have low expectations! This place poses as fine dining...and honestly the quality is lacking.  The medallions were the only stand out item.I live in San Francisco, where there are a lot of inexpensive options with a lot more value. Honestly, save yourself a buck. If you want better food for a synonymous price go to the Wolfgang Puck cafe at the MGM. If you want to spend $150 do the tasting menu at the Michael Minna restaurant down the way in the MGM. These both provide better food for your buck. I do want to reiterate, though , that the service here was great, despite the sub par cuisine."
139,I was very unimpressed with both the food and service. So unimpressed and indifferent that I can't think of anything else to say than I just didn't like it.
140,"After searching Yelp for weeks and posting a thread asking for anniversary dinner suggestions on the Strip (thanks, helpful Vegas Yelpers!!), my husband and I settled on Mon Ami Gabi.  I am SO glad we did.Had an 8:00pm reservation and when we got there we were greeted by the friendly hostess and taken right to our table.  We were seated in the really cute inside/outside patio area, which I would say definitely provides the best of both worlds.  You're seated in an open-air style setting, but still have a roof over your head and, best of all, air conditioning...which is crucial when you're dressed up all cute but are dying in the Vegas heat.  ; )  AND....you still have a view from your table of the beautiful Bellagio water show across the street.  PERFECT.  The only small thing I wished was different was that only one of us could face the street/show at our little two-seater table...would have been ideal to sit side by side and both enjoy the view.  : )Our waitress came to greet us and had lots of wonderful suggestions to share.  I ended up ordering the Thyme-Seared Salmon with Orzo Pasta & Lemon Butter sauce and my hubby ordered the Filet Mignon with Frites (thinly sliced fried potatoes...tasted to me like a cross between a french fry and potato chip).  The salmon was huge and the flavor of the sauce was outstanding....my husband also thoroughly enjoyed his filet.  They were both TO-DIE-FOR.....SOOO good.When it came time for dessert our waitress again made amazing recommendations...I got the Crème Brulee and my husband took her suggestion and tried the off-menu dessert special, which was a bread pudding with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream.  The Crème Brulee was really good, but I'd say the bread pudding was the winner....OMG.  I almost wanted to steal that from him.  ; )  She also highly recommended the Flourless Chocolate Cake, which I LOVE.  I wasn't in the mood for it that night, so will definitely try it on our next trip.  Our waitress was incredible....SO attentive and warm....making sure to take her time with us and check on us frequently....wishing us a Happy Anniversary at the beginning and end of our meal and even taking a keepsake picture of us with our camera.  She definitely made the experience a memorable one.If you are looking for a great place to spend a special occasion in Vegas without breaking the bank, I'd say this is definitely it.  Our check came out to only around $120 (including tip) for two entrees, two desserts, and two alcoholic drinks.  Not bad at all considering other places I researched on the Strip....Overall, I absolutely LOVED Mon Ami Gabi.  From the ambiance, to the food, to the view, the service....the entire experience was top notch!"
141,"Okay, so I give Mon Ami Gabi 5 stars for the atmosphere and 3 stars for the food; therefore, an overall score of 4.  My recommendation is to go here around 7:45pm, which is what we did, and then wait for about 20 minutes.  I definitely suggest eating outside, because you can enjoy the weather at this time.  Although it was about 104 degrees while we were visiting, it started to cool down at this time, and there's fans overhead to give you some breeze.  At 8pm the Bellagio fountain shows start and will replay every 15 minutes, which is perfect because then you can enjoy the music AND watch the show.  Lastly, you can people watch from your table, which is always very interesting : )The food was okay--we had the steak w/ butter sauce and the steak w/carmelized onions.  Both of the steaks were good, but not very memorable.  The escargot was covered in a pesto sauce and was okay.  The onion soup was so-so: it wasn't piping hot, and there was about an inch-thick layer of cheese.  My favorite part of the meal was the dessert: mixed berries with a buttery crumb topping and vanilla ice cream."
142,"Steak was OK, Let's just say I felt I over paid for blah food."
143,"Okay, so after my weekend trip from vegas, its official that Mon Ami Gabi is by far my fav breakfast spot ever!!! I wish I would have eaten there more this weekend because what we had was just great!!weekends only brunch... the most amazing french toast I have ever had. It was perfect! they serve it with syrup on the side, but it is the only french toast I've ever had that did not need any syrup, it would have ruined the perfectness of what was on the plate!!French TOast:-perfectly cooked so the center wasn't gooey-very thick bread (at least an inch)-thick homemade whipped cream that was not too sweet-bursting blueberries that were a perfect combination!!My hubby had the onion soup which he says is the best he's ever had (and he's a huge fan of onion soup!) & the steak sandwich, which he rates as a 5 out of 10, so perhaps you should just order the french toast if you make it to breakfast!!Go! Go! GO! Best of all you can sit outside and people watch and watch the watershow!! Mon Ami Gabi!!"
144,"90% of my love for this place was the view. We were inside but next to the open wall so we could watch the water show the entire time. The service was great. For an app I got the steamed artichoke which was only ok b/c i didn't care for the sauce that was served, it was a lemon sauce and just tasted too bitter. The scallops were delicious but there were only a few so I left hungry. I would go again though esp for the view."
145,"We really enjoyed this food -- went there for dinner, ordered Steak and Frittes and the special, Duck a L'orange, with a side of ratatouille.  Everything was wonderful, quaint, and actually felt like a Parisian restaurant (having been to Paris, I feel like I can say that).  Our service was great, our food was great, and it was a fun night for two poor honeymooners trying to live large in Vegas!"
146,"Came here for lunch on Monday.  I sat at the patio area, which is quite nice...it's right across from the Bellagio so you can watch the water show, although it's a bit blocked by the trees.  Prompt and nice service.  Meal came with a very delicious baguette.  Ordered the Onion soup, Chive Scrambled Crepe and Hamburger...I was surprised by the big portions  The Onion soup was very tasty...not overly salted like most places.  There's about an inch of cheese on top and although I LOVE melted cheese, it was a bit much for that amount of soup.  The crepe was pretty good...I think I would have enjoyed it more but I was stuffed with cheese from the soup.  Hamburger was good.  I love the frites...it's flat-cut slivers, kind of like a thick potato chip, less crunchy."
147,"Used to be lots of ""French"" restaurants out there, but now I realize how few remain after checking Mon Ami Gabi's menu with many authentic French offerings.   I'm not sure if the servers were truly French or just affecting an accent, but it works.  We had reservations and were seated promptly -- none of this sit at the bar while we find you a place.  I wasn't thrilled with the first table shown (near the bar and very noisy), so we were shown a much more peaceful table.    I had the baramundi special with a side of ratatouille which was excellent.  I'd wanted the pork tenderloin which was on the menu but they were out of it.  Already.  At 7 PM in Las Vegas.  Someone screwed up there.  But the fish was a worthy substitute.  Served with fingerling potatoes on a bed of deliciously flavored frisee.  My husband had the butternut squash with apple bisque.  It was fine.  Almost as good as an identical one I make at home.  He had a filet with merlot sauce.  Ordered medium rare, as it was served, yet, surprisingly dry.  And roasted beets which were very tasty.  Server was attentive but not hovering -- all I ask in a restaurant server.  Spouse had tarte tatin for dessert, I had chocolate mousse."
148,"Came here for a late night dinner after a memorable Vegas show. Although we made reservations it took them 10-15 min to set up our table and the front hostess has a bit of a snooty attitude towards us. We were seated by the outdoor balcony facing the Bellagio, which had a nice view. The complimentary french bread was very good, it was crunchy and warm. We also had a small complimentary dish from the chef, some sort of shaved carrots with lemon juice and pepper. It was refreshing and has a bit of a ting to it. I started off with the Soup du jour, which was butternut squash/apple soup.  It was creamy and had a very distinct butternut squash flavor. For entree, since it was a ""french steakhouse,"" I ordered the Steak Roquefort with blue cheese sauce, It was the blue cheese sauce that caught my attention. The steak was a thin 1/4"" thick flank steak, I assumed, with a wad of blue cheese sauce and some frites. I was a bit disappointed in the steak as it was a bit chewy and the exterior was grainy. The cheese sauce was good but I really expect the steak itself to be way better. In addition I ordered a side of ratatouille. My friends ordered the New York strip steak, which I was told was good, maybe I just didn't ordered the right item. Finally for dessert I ordered the sorbet, to be honest I really don't know what flavor it was, because when I ordered the waitress said it was blood orange, but it was nothing like blood orange, maybe I just heard it wrong. However, the sorbet was good and refreshing as you can imagine in the hot weather. Overall, service was average, food was not as good as I expected, but the view was magnificent. I give 3 stars for the food and 4 stars for the view, that's 3.5 stars, but I will have to dock 0.5 stars for the snooty hostess."
149,"I was so excited to have a nice dinner in vegas with my friends while on vacation.  I already researched the menu and knew what i want to get but when i got there I wanted to taste much more.  I ordered the smoked salmon on a brioche with creme fraiche, a goat cheese salad and then split the filet with hand cut pomme frites with a friend.  The one thing that was really good was my wine and they didn't make it!  I am pretty sure this elusive brioche was wonder bread with the crust cut off, the goat cheese salad was more bitter greens then anything else and the filet was overdone.  You ma ask how can you go wrong with pomme frites?! well they tasted like French's fried onions that you put on top of green bean casserole.  not good. I didn't even order the chocolate mousse i had previously been dreaming about.  Shame on you mon ami.....you are not my friend."
150,French Steakhouse?Then I must order a steak for my meal. I ordered the 22 ounce steak for $40 and a side. Very good! I asked for med rare and it came out MEDIUM RARE! Love that. The view was great and we saw the fountains every couple of minutes.I like how it's a French restaurant and I get to wear my Niner's jersey. GOOO NINERS! Won in overtime. I would go back again and try their other dishes. There is a cute blond chick that loves San Diego Chargers. She was obsessed. I like that.
151,"Are you looking for a friggin religious experience?  This is the place to get it. I went there with a friend who promised me this would be fabulous. i will admit, I was skeptical.  French food??? It's not for everyone.  This place will change your mind in an instant. We got there early on a Saturday, like 11 am, since the line is long and distinguished. We requested the patio since my friend knew from experience that this was the place to be.  Let me point out that the patio sits right on the strip, in front of the Eiffel tower at Paris, LV and DIRECTLY across from the Bellagio.  We ordered expensive wine, delicious creamy foods and watched the Belaggio water show under a perfect blue sky.  It was truly one of the most amazing experiences ever and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a fabulous day in Vegas.  You can't miss with Mon Ami Gabi."
152,"Mondure!A quick disclaimer: I didn't actually dine here; I joined a couple friends who were finishing their meal. That said, I got to witness the calamity of a party a few tables away get up from their booth in a tizzy, while waiters and managers swooped down on their area with police-style flashlights.And based on the patron's pained expressions, and the staff's serious faces, you KNOW they had to be looking for just one thing: VERMIN. In the middle of a heavily-packed, noisy dining room.Sacre bleu!Extra star because my friend maintains she enjoyed her steak very much."
153,"The Good:-Quick seating, but still do yourself a favor and make a reservation. -Affordable pricing (for Vegas)-Good Fries -Decent selection of champagne by the glass (Nice to find a place that doesn't push me to become a lush and buy the whole bottle)-Cute digs-Nice serving staff-Nice view of the water show at the BellagioThe Developmental Needs:-Medium-well steak (tried 3 different ways) felt a bit rubbery the first and second time we visited-Flavor in the food leaves a lot to be desired. Even the desserts didn't win me over. This made me sad. I'm not a huge fan but due to convenience and consistency with what they could execute well we went back twice. Definitely go and see what works for you. The location is great and perhaps there were just gems on the menu that we weren't able to try."
154,"THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOUWOW what a Yummy Yummy restaurant! The night before we had a horrible experience at Olives, and initially I had reservations for Delmonicos for this night. Everyone decided they aren't in the mood for steak so I wasn't about to go drop that much money for steaks that night. We decided to go to Mon Ami. What a great decision. My sister and I had eaten here a year before and remember it being just good. Like a fine wine, this place aged with grace. The Service- Impeccable. Thank you to our server Marlin, who was gracious, patient, courteous and seriously, one of the best waiters ever. He made the profession look good people. Everything was on time and with a smile. The Appetizers- Grilled Artichoke and Escargot. AMAZING. Perfect.Dinners- 3 different cuts of steak with delicious sides. One of the steaks was the special 24 oz Rib Eye- WOW.  Mule Frites (Mussels and French Fries) that reminded me of Paris. (Except they use the large, CA mussels). The French fries here are also flat stringy fries. But hey, a potato is a potato and it was fried just how I like it, CRISPY! :)Wine list is good too. Have Bordeaux. (Had one glass, and 2 beers)Dessert- Yes we had dessert too, were in Vegas after all. We had the chocolate mouse and the crème Brule with coffee. YUM Yum YUm all around. We were so full in the best way possible. And to top this all off, the bill for 4 people, for all this deliciousness and service...$189.00. WHAT? I had to look twice. I couldn't believe it!!!! I was happy.The atmosphere was also so romantic, friendly and it's a huge place. PLUS they also have a huge patio area that faces the Bellagio fountains. FORGET trashy/snobby Olives and come to Mon Ami Gabi!!!I will absolutely make this restaurant a regular on my list when I go to Vegas."
155,"I have visited this restaurant on two separate trips to Vegas. On the first, it was for lunch, and was just fine. The prices were a *teeny bit high, but not too bad, and the food was good. The second was for a large bachelorette party dinner - and it didn't turn out as nicely. Pros: They got us all seated at one long tableThe service was very attentiveThe cocktail I ordered was fabulous (Gabitini!)The desserts were to die forCons: We were seated 20 minutes late, even though we had made a reservation months in advanceWe had drinks in the casino that they wouldn't let us bring insideThe prices were UNBELIEVABLY high for what we got - $25 for mediocre chicken and steak and $12-$15 for dinner salad is not okay, and wine was out of control (our bill for 15 peeps was $885!)Also, frites should be nummy fries, not rock hard tiny, and crunchy teeth-breakingThe aforementioned chicken made me sick later as wellSo look - I think this place might be just fine if you stick to certain dishes - or maybe just drinks & dessert. We may have just been there on an off night as far as food goes, but the dinner prices were so ridic that I definitely won't be visiting My Friend Gabi on my next LV trip."
156,"We figured....last minute ressie, not crowded....random Paris hotel location, french steakhouse, whatever, I *guess* it'll be an OKAY dinner.Not so much, it was absolutely wonderful! We all shared a bunch of things and left fat, happy and shocked it was so affordable given how we all rolled outta there.Quick service...cocktails were super fun, dessert chocolate mousse and profiteroles amazing...steak succulent and done perfectly, appetizers were OHHHHH good, and the WARM BAGUETTES OF BREAD delivered to your table 3 at a time????? Heaven, how did they know I am a carb whore....more please."
157,"We booked this last minute when we realized another restaurant was too far away and so glad we did.  The  food was amazing and huge portions!  You can sit inside or outside and we ended up inside with a nice dark ambience with candles and delicious food! We ordered some appetizers:Smoked salmon (Best tasting ever!)Steamed mussels (Wowsa!)Fresh warm bagette bread ( They kept bringing us more and we could not stop eatting every soft, warm bite!)Main dish:Peppercorn Steak with Frites and a pear salad on the side! (Steak was perfection and so juicy! Frites were a little bit salty)  I split it with someone and could barely eat it all!  We also had to try dessert and shared a chocolate mousse and profiteroles that were so good and just enough dark chocolate taste!They also have a good drink menu and I just loved my mojito since it was not too sweet but nice and minty.  Amazing service considering they were packed!  You have to go here for dinner!!"
158,"I must give this restaurant a second visit.  The reviews suggest that we had an isolated mediocre experience.  Beautiful day to sit on the patio and enjoy the warm sun and view of the fountains.  A decent, slightly dirty martini and I was a pretty happy girl. Then our lunch arrived.  BJ's Cavatelli Pasta & Chicken was pretty yummy, my friend's Salmon Burger was also good.  My steak sandwich was just not good.  The meat was tough and chewy. The frites, however, were delicious.What I should have done was have a Yelp-recommended dessert.  Instead, another dirty martini.  Out in the sun.  Cut to Lizzie, heading for un petit somme."
159,"This is my favorite restaurant in Vegas. It's usually downstairs from my room in my favorite hotel. Get outside seating if you can, otherwise it really is like being in France with all the cigarette smoke."
160,"I really like this restaurant. Both my husband and I loved our meal. We got the mac and cheese - very greasy but delicious! He had a burger and I had the ham and cheese grilled sandwich. It sounds pretty plain but this place gives it their own twist. The ""French fries"" were more like crispy fried chips - very good! We ate inside since the wait for outside was long. This was a Saturday afternoon so that was understandable. Our waitress was very nice and the service was good. I would definitely go back here again next time we go to Vegas."
161,"In the vast, expensive, style-over-substance that is the Las Vegas strip, this restaurant is a jewel. The food is superb, the service quite good by local standards, prices are very reasonable, the atmosphere inside and out are wonderful. The soups, salads, and entrees have been very very nice, fresh and perfectly cooked. I've been twice with a group of friends and we had a very good time. Really an oasis in this culinary desert."
162,"My wife and I came here for an anniversary dinner and we couldn't have been happier. The service was excellent, the food was exceptional though not exotic, and they even gave us a mini desert for free as a ""Happy Anniversary"".The view was good even from the cafe style area and the decor was very traditional (many Vegas restaurants seem to be getting either more garish or more ""modern"").Reservations are highly recommended but unfortunately you can't reserve outside seating (which is why this is 4 stars instead of 5)."
163,I have went to Vegas and passed this place so many times and I ask my self why?? It is prime location and it is affortable and was/is the BEST meal I have ever have. Oh my god I was going to get the fish but I am so glad I didn't because the steak was to die for even if you not a steak fan WOW. And you have to have the french fries so good. I wish you could order a plate of food online. I went on my birthday and it was perfect!
164,"Some might have had a good meal or two here but my experience wasn't good. I got the oysters and I took a closer look at them. I saw tiny little wormlike insects swarming all over them. Tiny little black maggots looking things in my oysters, I was pretty grossed out so I didn't eat that night and the nice waiter apologized but the manager was a douchebag didn't seem to give a crap. My friend got steak frites. Steak was dry tasteless and fries were soggy.* horrible management, rude manager* the wait was so long* contaminated, disease ridden food."
165,"Based on oour extensive prior extremely positive experiences, my wife and I, plus three other couples, made sure to visit MAG for a nice dinner on our final night in Vegas earlier this week.  We could have been seated immediately inside, but it was a beautiful November night and we opted to wait--heck, rolling some dice, plus free table drinks for 40 minutes, no problem.We finally get seated and they squeeze us into a four-top.  That's OK, we like each other and expected to be squeezed.  If you're new, be warned that they put about 250 diners in a space that any other restaurant would put 100.  For us, not a great big deal because of the anticipation of excellent food and the great view of the strip and the Bellagio water shows.And the aniticipation grew and grew until about an hour after ordering we finally got our meals.  The waitress explained that she had waited to talk to the chef about an allergy issue one of us had before putting any of the orders in.  I'm sorry, but when you are sitting at an uncomfortable table and will end up paying about $150/person, you shouldn't have to wait an hour to get served.When the entrees finally got there, they were all very excellent, but those who bided their ample time by eating bread and appetizers could not finish their entrees.  About the only bad entree choice anyone mentioned was the duck confit, which seemed to have about 1 ounce of meat on a bone, and not great flavor.The onion soup appetizer was horribly cheesy and not as good as on prior visits.  But the filets and steaks, with fantastic Bernaise sauce, are definitely to die for, and it will likely contribute to my demise. So after taking about 30 minutes to get through the meal (things go slower when you have to wait for the person next to you to finish using their knife before you do so you don't cut each other open), we then proceeded to wait and wait another 30 minutes to get the check.  It's not like we wanted to further enjoy the nice night--by now it was after 10:00 and the temperature had dropped about 20 degrees in the past hour.  We were so anxious to leave, no one dared venture into the desserts.And the worst part was, when we make it back to the craps table, we had just missed a 45 minute roll.  Would have paid for our entire visit, and then some, had we not had to wait for the waitress all night.Oh well, life is all about memories, and we'll still have memories of some great meals here.  Probably won't come back, except perhaps for lunch and the best boulliabaise you could ever get.I really feel bad about giving three stars.  Lat week I would have given 5 plus.  It's true what they say that one bad experience overshadows hundreds of good ones.  C'est le vie."
166,"my girlfriend and i were planning a special night of dinner and checking out Le Reve.  After reading the reviews here about Mon Ami Gabi, it sounded like a no brainer. And boy was i right!!! Just walking into the place i imediately knew it was gonna be good.  we sat inside in the parlor room (i recommend). outside was just a bit too noisy with strip traffic.  i ordered the steak au poivre. my girlfriend the french onion soup with a side of crab cakes..mmmm...the steak was tender and the frites were just perfect!!  the wine list made me wanna stay the whole night alone.we made reservations which i would strongly suggest to avoid long waits."
167,"The 7 of us went for our Thanksgiving dinner (without a reservation!) and was seated close to the window with a fabulous view of the Bellagio fountains. The lights were so dim that I had a hard time looking at the menu but guess that's part of the romantic atmosphere. Started off with the Escargots de Bourgogne and the Shrimp Gabi. Both were delicious. The steaks all came with a generous helping of Frites. Good amount of steak for the price. They were all prepared the way we had requested.  I had the New York Strip Steak prepared rare.  That was one big stripe!  It had to have been an inch thick.  The baguettes were warm, fresh and crunchy on the outside. Our waiter was quick and courteous. Overall it was a great experience. Prices were decent plus you get that great view.  Service was great.  Food was great.  Only complaint is the extremely dim lighting."
168,"Went a few years ago with the family while we all happend to be in town.  Yes, it was that good, that a few years later, I'm still raving about this place!Shrimp Gabi and Steamed Mussels appetizers - shrimp was cooked perfectly.Steak Au Poivre - my god.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  I have yet to order steak in a restaurant and have it come out as perfect as it has at MAG.  You want Medium rare?  You will get medium rare.  'nuff said.If you even have room for desert after all this gastric-orgasmic experience, try the creme brulee.  Or better yet, the Banana foster crepe.  Oh.  My.  God.  Entrees do not come with sides, everything is ala carte.  Order one or two sides for the table to share.  It's worth it.  Trust me.This place was one of my first ""anything goes"" experiences in Vegas.  Loved that I was eating in high-class french restaurant in shorts and sandals (their only dress code requirements are no swimwear, and no sleeveless t-shirts).And by god sakes people.  It is Vegas, after all, so I cannot stress enough... CALL AHEAD for a reservation.  You cannot reserve a table on the patio, but if you get by the windows in the Atrium, it's just as good (if not better, since we were there in August with 110 degree heat!).Definitely would go back.  Probably am the next trip."
169,"We always lunch on the patio here when visiting Las Vegas. Great food, good service, and the very best place for people- and fountain-watching on the strip. It's directly across from the Bellagio, so in addition to getting to watch all the characters on the strip, you get to see the gorgeous fountains and hear the lovely music from across the street. I've eating here several times, the food is wonderful. I highly recommend the skate, it's stingray served with a cold vegetable salad that includes fennel, so crisp and refreshing. The steak frites, quiche, and creme brulee are also excelent choices."
170,"A nice French restaurant at the Paris resort.  My friends and I went there for brunch during our weekend in Vegas and were completely satisfied with everything.What initially peaked our interest was the bloody mary bar.  Two of my friends partook and went and created their own bloody maries.  When you arrive, they provide baguettes in the paper bags you would receive if you bought them at a boulangerie in France.  I had a croque monsieur with fries and a mimosa.  The sandwich was good and so was the mimosa.  The fries were unique.  They were cut very thin.  My friends ordered other sandwiches and salads and everyone was very happy with their meal.  We sat outside b/c it was a beautiful, sunny afternoon.  The staff let us linger at the table for two hours as we ate, drank and laughed.  Since Paris is across the street from the Bellagio, we were able to witness the musical fountain shows every 1/2 an hour.  It made us laugh to watch the fountains soar into the sky to the voice of Celine Dion.  Great food, friendly staff, good drinks.  Would return when in the mood for French food."
171,"We had lunch there and it was all right, nothing to complain about, but nothing to justify more than three stars either. Expensive, like everything at major Vegas hotels."
172,"TEN stars out of 5!!!!  This place was awesome!  We came here on a Thursday night around 9pm, so there was no wait at all.  Plus, it was Dec. 18th, which I guess is historically one of the slowest times in Vegas.  Anyway, our server went ahead and gave some recommendations for entrees and man, am I glad I went with his suggestions!  My husband and I both ordered the filet with Merlot butter reduction.  I am not even joking, this is most likely the best meal I have ever had in my life.  The filet was PERFECT.  Super tender, moist, and absolutely delicious when coupled with the merlot sauce!  The super thin fries are really interesting.  We also shared a plate of garlic spinach (which, btw, was definitely big enough for 2 to share) which was quite tasty.  For dessert, we got the chocolate mousse which was also excellent!  The service was great.  Our server offered for us to have a taste of the wine we were considering buying a bottle of....and that was indeed a great idea since we liked it a lot and bought the bottle.  Ambiance is very nice and you can't beat an evening view of the Bellagio fountains!  We sat inside right by the window.  We couldn't hear the music when the fountain show was on, but oh well.  That's a very minor drawback.  Overall, it was absolutely fabulous.  Next time we're in Vegas, we are definitely coming back here!"
173,"A very small selection (basically, steak, fries and that's it) but a good rating because it was very good."
174,"This is an example of another reason Vegas is a difficult place for a normal person.  The entire experience was, frankly, magical.  The service was a bit obsequious, but she was lovely, friendly, and warm.This is a casual eatery we walked into in Paris and had no reservations.  It was a Saturday night, and we were sat by a lovely, romantic window within seconds.The atmosphere was incredible.... across from the Bellagio Water Show, and next to a window in a romantically lit restaurant that had a wonderful aesthetic... tiled floors (slippery in heels), lovely deep wooden grain finish on the classic bar.  It was as close to a dimly lit French bistro as you might find out of France.The food was awesome.... The oysters had one of the best mignonette's I have ever had.  For Las Vegas, oyster country (sarcasm button on), they were fresh and shucked decently.  Luckily, nothing like Andy K.The Endive and Blue Cheese salad with watercress and roasted pear was sublime.  The French Onion soup was great.  Again, I don't like it sweeter than smoky or ""zesty""... but it was great.The Salade Maison was very good, but the presentation of the goat cheese and croutons being the piece of toast with cheese spread ontop of it was confusing... in that Lauren ate that without realizing that was the ""goat cheese & croutons"" inherent to the salad.The French Martini was great (grey goose with pineapple, champagne, and chambord....)The French 75 was perfect.  I subbed beefeater for the sapphire, and it was just awesome.  AWESOME!But being on the strip, even a casual, non reservation type of meal... the bill came to $140 or something.  1 app, 2 salads, 4 cocktails, one soup.... $140.I know it is demanding to ask Vegas to be cheap, but to sit for a couple apps and salads and see a bill like that is just... disheartening.So... go to Vegas with money.  PLEASE PLEASE shove cost out of your head prior to sitting down ANYWHERE.Because Vegas is pricey.  Check out my Las Vegas as to why.... but it isn't just expensive.  I work in fine dining and high end hotels, and the price point is at least 20%-35% over a normal meal.  As long as you recognize that, even a casual, spur of the moment meal can be magical, romantic, delicious, and stunning.I would go back here in a second, with the awareness I wish I had previously had.  I think having not been to vegas much, it is something I simply need to plan for across the board."
175,"Huge disappointment - after reading all the great reviews on Yelp, I decided to have my family's Christmas dinner at Mon Ami Gabi.  Perhaps it was Christmas and the chef wasn't around or there was no delivery of fresh steak on Christmas day or whatever, but the steaks were the worst we've ever had at a restaurant that claimed to be a steakhouse of any sort.        We had the following: - French onion soup - standard, decent, not spectacular- Frisee & bacon salad - tasty- Steak au poivre- Steak roquefort- Filet mignon with merlot butter  and red wine reductionI think the problem is with quality of the steaks, the sauces were fine, but my mom's steak roquefort had the texture of cotton, my sister's steak au poivre had the texture of cotton with lots of veins and fat lumps, my filet mignon had a stringy texture like a inferior cut of meat and was not at all firm.  It was so bad that we left much of the entree untouched and left right after the main course, we didn't even have dessert on Christmas!!  This was a very disappointing meal and ruined our Christmas.  On the other hand, the service was fine and the  prices were definitely cheaper than traditional steakhouses, $31 for the filet and $23 for the regular steaks, but the quality is not anywhere near Ruth Chris, Morton or Fleming's."
176,We had a dozen fanny bay oysters. Great champagne vinagrettte. across the strip from Bellagio. Reccommendation: not outside. Right inside by the bar. Not under the sun. they have open doors so you still feel outside without being under the vegas sun. Ill go again.
177,"Lunch review.  Given the location, Gabi could charge more.  I'd be very happy, and very tempted, if Gabi were a local establishment.  The quiche was amazingly fluffy; it's the best quiche I've had by an immeasurable margin.  The steak sandwich was juicy and flavorful, with Stilton, caramelized onions, and chive mayonnaise.  Most importantly, the beef was pronounced and tasty.Service was sluggish, despite the relatively empty dining room. Highly recommended for lunch.  Better than anything I've had in Paris."
178,"I ordered the caramelized onion/ red wine sauce steak. Great portion, very juicy, tender, and cooked to perfection. Too bad my appetite wasn't too great after nights of alcohol binging. The side of crispy fries was very interesting. The ambiance was absolutely perfect for a cozy dinner with a signficant other/ friends/ family/ coworker etc. Classy and sophisticated. Definitely would come back here for a classy evening out."
179,"I was staying at the Paris and I would always see people doing the al fresco dining when I'd walk pass, so I thought I'd stop in and try to grab a quick meal before flying out that afternoon.Actually because of that flight, the waiter said he'd talk to the kitchen to expedite my meal.  My seat wasn't outside, but I had a nice sunny window seat.    I ordered the full order of mussels which came with frites.  Moules et frites are my favorite!!  What I really liked though is they dropped off a fresh warm baguette in a bag at every table.  There's nothing I like more than being able to dip bread into the stockpot of mussels.  Well the meal came out after about 15 minutes...either it wasn't expedited or I'm scared to see how long it'd take normally.  The mussels were really good in a nice stock that wasn't too rich.  The ""handmade"" frites came in a paper cone on a stand and had a nice thin and flat shape, but I thought they tasted a bit stale.  I wonder if I just had a bad batch.  I'd definitely come back for the mussels.      In the end, I jogged out of the restaurant and left the strip an hour before my flight was to depart; barely making my flight."
180,"Spectacular!!! Not long after we were seated, a fresh warm baguette in a bag was served. We ordered Escargots de Bourgogne , a dozen of oyster, Filet mignon with merlot butter, bone-in ribeye, Sea Scallops Gratinees for 4 of us. Since we all shared our foods and get to taste everything we ordered, Both filet Mignon and rib-eye are tender and juicy, practically melted in your mouth, Escargots are tender with roasted garlic flavoured, and oyster are fresh. PERFECT!!! I mean everything we ordered . We were seated outside in front of an evening view of the Bellagio fountains, It was really nice to have your dinner while a beautiful water show presents before your eyes, however, it was sad while it was playing ""Time to say goodbye"" when we were about finishing our dinner Yes,we are leaving in the morning, somehow we know we are gonna to miss this place."
181,"First time visit - Brunch experience. Sat in the glass enclosed seating area with brilliant sunlight coming through. Atmosphere was comforting and prices were affordable. The waiter scraped up the bread crumbs and accidentally scooped all the crumbs onto our bags. The hilarious part was that he made such a good effort and pretended that he did not see his mistake and walked away casually. I got a kick out of it.Second time visit - Ordered the steak special. Good but nothing too special. Actually, if you're in it for a bargain, this place works for just that. My steak can be divided into 2 pieces and still feed two grown men. However, quality of food is just a-ok. I probably would opt to pay $10-$15 more elsewhere and have something that would be great."
182,"I love the Paris hotel and this place is super cute, but they don't have their act together. At least they didn't this day. OK, it was New Year's weekend, but.... There was a line for lunch right at opening time, but they just kep the line static while tons of servers and hosts were standing there doing nothing. So we were just left staring at them and all the open tables waiting for us.  What's the hold up people? A bit later they actually asked me and my friend if we wanted an outdoor table and we said of course because the patio is outside on the strip so you can people watch while eating.  So they took us out of the line and then told us that it would be a 30 minute wait for the patio and to wait ""over here to the side"". But we were almost in the front of the line before, and we weren't informed abou the wait for the patio before making our decision! So we had to hound them to put us back in our spot in line for an inside table--and they weren't too gracious about it.Our server was nice, and when he knocked one of our mimosas over (which was less than half full,) he gave us 2 more for free. The food fell flat.  The warm bread was nice and the mimosas were good, but our croque-monsieurs, which we thought would be a good hangover dish, were dry and flavorless. The fries were horrible--some over fried, hollow weird-shaped things.  A French restaurant that can't do fries?It's a shame we didn't have a better experience because the place is adorable and the menu looked good. Maybe dinner is better."
183,"First Time visit-We had a reservation for Mon Ami Gabi on Christmas eve at Paris hotel and casino. The restaurant is very easy to find within Paris and in the front of the casino. We were late for our reservation and they were pretty much dead and seated us right away. We sat on the patio since they had spots available. For anyone that was out there that week knows it was cold and we still sat out on the patio. They had a lot of heaters that made it a very pleasant experience still to be outside. First off the view from the patio is great and for me is the reason you come here you have a great but not uninstructed view of the Bellagio fountains and great to people watch. Very good date place to impress your special someone. Second, the waiter and everyone working at Mon Ami Gabi was great. The waiter noticed my Atlanta Falcons hat that I had taken off and put on the chair and started talking that he was from Atlanta and that he had family in Kennesaw, GA. Impressed that he noticed this and struck up a conversation that was personal to the people at his table. They had a great selection of food and prices were not bad compared to other locations I've been to and seen in Las Vegas. I'm by no means an expert on french food and this was the first time I've tried it. My family makes quiche a lot and I hate it. But, figured I would try it here and I have to say I loved it. So much I've got all the ingredients to try and make at home. Food was great for myself and my friend. We ordered the Chicken & Gruyere Crepe, Classic quiche Lorraine, and a diet Pepsi and the total without tip was 30.06. Not too bad in Vegas standards. I did not try any wine but they had a great wine selection from what I looked at. I really liked this place and will keep this on my list to go back as I continue to plan on going to Vegas every year. This place gets Big thumbs up from me. The atmosphere inside and out of the restaurant was great, food was great, and service was awesome. A great Christmas eve lunch I'll never forget. I suggest it to anyone thinking about this place.__________________"
184,"I'm partial to French cooking so I always try to eat at Mon Ami Gabi when I'm in Vegas.   It's located in the Paris casino overlooking the Las Vegas strip.  If you manage to score a seat outside you'll get a great view of not only the human traffic on the strip but of the fountain show across the street at the Bellagio.  I always have the same meal only varying on which type of Steak Frites: French Onion Soup, Steak Frites and Crème Brûlée.   The Steak Frites is a treat for me because it gives me a break from the usual steakhouse fare of filets, ribeyes and strips (although they serve those as well).   It's simple to make and there's nothing better to eat.  It's a thin, lean cut with less marbling and best cooked rare to medium rare.   My favorites are the Steak Clasique, Steak Roquefort or Steak Bearnaise.  You'll also find many other French staples such as baguettes and escargot."
185,"Gabi, you are indeed a good friend.  I've been to both locations in Chicago as well as this one in Vegas.  It's perfectly located in the Paris hotel.For chain french food, this place is very good.  We went for brunch on a Sunday and enjoyed the crepes.  The smoked salmon and the cheese plate were also great appetizers.  If the weather permits, request to sit outside on the patio as it gives you a great view of the Bellagio fountains.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is very french, even if the crowd isn't.The one odd thing was that they ran out of iced tea during our meal, but they made good on it by subtracting the teas from our bill.Props to the Paris hotel for targeting the gay market.  The BF and I were pleased to be seated next to four family boys during our lunch.  All in all, brunch at Mon Ami Gabi is a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon in Las Vegas."
186,"It's simple--great food, amazing view, impeccable service."
187,"I love the French. Went here for dinner before the O show at the Bellagio. We were late for our reservations but no problem - we were still seated right away. Loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. Dimly lit with dark decor. Totally reminded me of being in a French bistro (and yes, I have been in a real French bistro in France). Started off with the onion soup au gratin which was tasty and ooey gooey cheesy. I liked how they had slices of baguette with the crust still on which gave it great texture and flavor. I have to admit though that it was a tad salty for my liking but I finished it anyway. For our entree, I got the filet with merlot butter and red wine reduction and the fiance got the trout Grenobloise. I got my filet cooked medium and when I got it, it was perfectly cooked. Juicy and fork tender. It literally melted in my mouth. I didn't get to try my fiance's trout however it was a rather large portion and he was very content with his rich and savory dish. I also have to a say that service was superb. They were quite attentive with our drinks with always refilling our glasses when the were getting empty. Also our soup came out in no time and our entrees were also presented to us before we finished our soup. Our waiter was gracious enough to take our entrees back to the kitchen to say warm until we finished our soup. Dining at Mon Ami Gabi was a fantastic experience. Loved every minute and bite that I had. I surely will eat here again on my next trip!"
188,"Do you like a little drama with your soup? Do you want a burger that could make you cry? What about a bloody mary that can be a meal unto itself? Throw in a little bit of a view and you have Mon Ami Gabi! Sure I wanted to sit outside on the patio, under the perfect Las Vegas sun and pretend I was in Paris, but so did everyone else. Second best option sit inside up against the glass windows and enjoy the sun pouring in onto your face. Actually option two was better because the deuce was all ours. We weren't bumping into other tables. What better way to start a Sunday morning brunch than with a bloody mary. Not just any ole bloody mary but the ""make it yourself"" bloody mary. Bring me half a glass of vodka (yes that is correct) and walk over to the bloody mary fix-it bar to create your little ""mary masterpiece"". So many different mixes and garnishes. I went with the crisp strips of bacon, pepperoni stick, mandatory celery stick and one caper berry. (I actually went really tacky and piled the bacon in like some of the patrons at the Bellagio buffet do with their plates of food.) Once back at my table I deconstructed the bloody mary and enjoyed each component unto itself. I really didn't need food after this ordeal but I went ahead anyway. The soup of the day was a cream of wild mushroom soup garnished with chanterelle mushrooms and celery root puree. The shallow bowl comes to the table with the garnish smack in the middle and then the show begins. From behind her back the actress (waitress) pulls a large cast iron kettle billowing with steam. From high above she tilts it aiming into my bowl below, pouring the most velvety looking soup ever. Not a drop was splattered and just the right amount surround the garnish perfectly. I have one thing to say: D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S What would have just rounded it out would have been a drizzle of truffle oil. Orgasm! And at last the main course. A perfectly cooked, med rare burger with Gruyere and yes more bacon. All setting nicely on a brioche bun with a side of string fries and cornichorn. OINK! You Betcha!"
189,"Not a bad choice I made for dinner, if I do say so myself.  Directly across from the fountains at the Bellagio,  inside the Paris casino, it's about as European as you can get in Vegas.  It's dark, romantic, and seductive, the waitstaff (or at least our waiter) has excellent manners, and the busboys refill your water regularly, and the prices are very reasonable for the level of service and quality.  An excellent, well-organized, French-style restaurant.  They made a little boo-boo on my girlfriend's order, but from my standpoint it was just about perfect.  Oh, and Betty H. just reminded me of how they put a mini baguette right on the table in the bag - a classy touch, and fresh, tasty bread to boot, with your choice of whipped butter or whipped carrots.  I chose . . . both.You might think that a vegetarian foodie (some of you don't understand that there is such a thing, but I'll let you catch up) wouldn't be able to find anything at a French restaurant, but au contraire, mon frere - they have a vegetarian sampler that is anything but an afterthought.  Garlic spinach, some spicy lentils, asparagus, potatoes au gratin, green beans, and whipped cauliflower . . . it's like someone made your vitamins delicious . . . and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite, and my beat-down-by-Vegas body was reinvigorated.  The wine selection is good, but I opted for the brewed-in-Quebec triple Belgian beer, the Fin du Monde, and like Frank the Tank would say, ""It feels so good when it hits your lips . . . so good!""One word of caution, though - the bathroom is out the door inside the casino and around the corner, so depending on where you're sitting, it might be a hike . . . and the water and the wine keep coming . . ."
190,"The boy was right, and decided at just the right moment to have us sit down and rest our weary feet inside the Paris casino. Hey, if I can't get to Paris itself, at least give me some wine and some fountains to stare at and I'll be happy. Throw in some fancy meat and you may get lucky.The wait staff was nice and accommodating. My water was constantly refilled,and I had no idea how hungry I was until I nearly ate half the free bread on the table myself. I ordered the Salad Maison to start, lured in by the goat cheese crouton. It was your average salad, but very fresh and came with a great balsamic dressing. I can never recreate those at home. I also intended on ordering the roast pork and a lovely glass of Beaujolais, but instead, was given roast chicken and a glass of merlot. The merlot i let slide, but when I want my pork, rotisserie chicken does not suffice! Blame it on my cleavage, I know some people get distracted...but how does ""Beaujolais"" sound like ""Merlot"" and hows does Pork Roast, sound like ""chicken""? The waiter was also an original Nor Cal native and very nice, so I wasn't bothered. I got a complimentary refill on my merlot and my pork came shortly thereafter. I passed the time munching on the boy's veggie plate--which I did envy. It was gorgeous, full of fresh, seasonal, comfort veggies and he was a member of the clean plate club. Garlic spinach, mashed cauliflower, roasted potatoes etc... delicious.When my roast arrived, I blushed. I called it the ""Pork Lollypop"" since really, I don't get much fancier than ground turkey or Trader Joe's chicken strips these days on the dole. I was in pork heaven. Nestled gently on a pile of mashed potatoes with succulent roasted carrots wedged on it's sides, this roast was bathed in a savory citrus sauce--like nothing I've ever tasted, and probably won't for a while more. Excellent service, reasonable Vegas prices for food that does not include french fries or gas bubbles and a great decor. It was dimly lit, sexy and I had a view of the Bellagio fountains from the table, minus the 20 degree wind chill factor. Oo la la!"
191,The scallops here were the best scallops I've ever  had in my life. What's there more to expound upon?
192,"The restaurant was very dark but had a nice view of the strip. Probably a really nice place to eat on the patio during the summer. Decent view of the Bellagio fountain show, even though there are a bunch of big ass trees in the way!! That's all on Bellagio though... Got the hanger steak and it was really good. Escargo was decent as well. Service was ok and so were the prices. Go here for a classy, nice meal for an above average price."
193,"We had a great departing lunch at Mon Ami Gabi this last Sunday. Mon Ami is one of my faves in town for lunch.  Not so much at night, but almost always for lunch. I love to sit in the atrium and people watch.We ate and drank some truly fine French bistro food.T and I started with a dozen oysters. The waistress said they were most like Fanny Bays, but I thought these were smaller and sweeter.  Delish. Lots of lemon, mignonette with tons of shallots and fresh grated horseradish.D started with the frisee au lardon (frisee and bacon salad here in the US where they are probably afraid of the word lardons.)  Because I had this for my entree I can comment upon it. It was delicious. Poached egg, slightly warm frisee, lots of chunks of bacon. Light vinaigrette.  V good.For an entree C had the Croque Monsieur, which was a little unorthodix because it was not open face. However, it had tons of cheese and ham. It was really a lovely tasty sandie.  T and I both drank glasses of a French Vouvray that was enormously delicious.   It had an ever so slight effervescence.  And the price was right, 9.50 on the wine list.I took off one star because their fries suck azz. They anger me."
194,"I have visited this bistro several times since Paris hotel and casino is one of my favorite casinos to visit when I am in Vegas.  I was also familiar with the original in Chicago.This last visit was not a happy occassion but you can only stand homecooked food for a certain time before you decide to go out when you visit family.The meal itself was good, I had steak dijon well done (as requested)and my partner had the skate.  He had the soup of the day vegetarian style (very good) and I had the salade maison. Overall the whole meal was satisfactory including the drinks.  One note, bistros are normally small in France and in the context of Vegas, nothing is small so this one has a lot of space and its outdoor patio has the view of the dancing fountains of Bellagio.  The service itself is exemplary except for the wait.  The salad and the soup came on a reasonable time but the entree was really a long wait.  In any restaurant, this is not excusable especially for a place not really very crowded.  When you finish the appetizer/soup/salad, you expect the dinner to come at an appropriate time.  Little quibble but prices should reflect overall service, food, timing and other extras.One more thing, great warm bread and always ask for more if you are really enjoying, it will be good for your soup and waiting on the rest of the dinner.No dessert to review, only had espresso. Overall recommended but not highly."
195,"Went here for a late dinner (around 10:30pm) on a Friday night. We had wanted to check out the Paris hotel and get a bit to eat and Mon Ami Gabi was one of the only restaurants still open in the hotel. It did take us quite a while to decide what we wanted seeing as the menu is mostly steak and neither me or the bf are quite fond of it. I settled on the lemon chicken, with hesitation because it didn't seem very French but was one of the only things that appealed to me. The bf had the salmon and both turned out to be very good. The mini baguette and butter was also quite tasty and the restaurant is very cute inside. My favorite part of the meal, however, was the sparkling rose', of which I had two glasses.I would recomment Mon Ami Gabi if you are a fan of steak and don't mind paying $30 for it."
196,"Bloody. Mary. Bar. With. Slim. Jims. (as a garnish) In. Vegas.That makes up for the fact that my boyfriend's poached egg was underdone.But then again, sitting on the patio watching the Bellagio fountain and drunk people whilst drinking Bloody Marys does too."
197,"Full disclosure: I used to work at Harrah's Entertainment, which owns Paris Las Vegas.I wish I liked this restaurant more than I actually do.  Mon Ami used to be my go-to for a good solid dining experience at a reasonable price on the Strip.  I'd get seats outside on the patio, and on a nice LV night, you have a fantastic experience, watching the degenerate LV tourists and having a front row seat to the Bellagio water show.  I have probably been there about half a dozen times.The service is generally very friendly and competent.  The food, in the past, has been quite good.  Prices are mid-level for Las Vegas.  The restaurant is very dark, depending on where you sit, and so it's really difficult to comment on the decor.  However, the last time I ate there (September 2008), the food was cold and took forever.  I had put my name in but waited far longer than expected.  I don't mind dealing with the latter, but the former really made me an unhappy camper, particularly because it's always been so good in the past.  Another disappointment was that the ginger ale that used to be served was very authentic ginger ale, and very tasty.  Unfortunately, that's changed over to cheap Canada Dry-style ginger ale.  An annoying feature - you cannot make reservations in advance.  You basically have to show up and put your name in, then wait around forever.  This of course, delights Harrah's Entertainment, owners of Paris (though the casino does not own Mon Ami Gabi, unlike some of the other eateries on the property).  Based on my last experience, I find myself very hesitant to recommend this restaurant to friends, so I sadly can't very well recommend it on Yelp, can I?  You'll probably do better if the restaurant isn't slammed (we were there on a Saturday night, peak dinner rush this last time).  At least, I hope so.The restaurant is right off the Strip, so expect a nice long walk from the garage.  It can be noisy, and I generally wouldn't characterize it as being a romantic restaurant in a traditional sense (quiet, intimate), but it might be enjoyable if it returns to its roots."
198,"Get a table on the patio.  One of the only places to eat outside in Vegas.  How crazy is that?  Either way this place is quite a find.  The hanger steak is delicious.  Just relax and take in the Bellagio water show across the street.  If God forbid, I ever find myself in Vegas again, I'm eating here."
199,"My boyfriend took me here for Valentine's Day and oh man, was it amazing ! As mentioned in the other reviews, the view of the Bellagio Fountains Show is beautiful ! The service was wonderful. We never had to ask for anything. The waitress makes you feel welcomed and special by speaking to you like an actual person rather than JUST a customer. The Shrimp Gabi was savory, melt in your mouth, flavor ! The steak was tender, soft, and so yummy. I don't even like veggies and I enjoyed the green beans ! Don't come here without trying the Shrimp Gabi. Really. Okay ?"
200,"Lunch was OK.  I had the soup de jour (lobster bisque) and the smoked salmon appitizer.  It was my first time tasting the soup...I thought it was going to be warm, but it was not warm at all.  The bread was so gooood!  I only way I finished my soup was dipping the bread in it.  I hardly touched my smoked salmon.  It was nothing special.  The patio seating was great!  I enjoyed watching the Bellagio fountian show!  I would come back, but I would not order the same plates."
201,"I love having Sunday Champagne Brunch here..be sure to sit on the patio or the sun room.  They're meal crepes are delicious and perfect after a long weekend of dancing, hard partying, not sleeping, being hungover, and aching feet. And, well I loveeeeee getting their escargot. Came for dinner once awhile back, the food was pretty good and they have a very extensive wine list with a lot of wines that I've very much enjoyed."
202,"I came to Mon Ami Gabi for a Sunday brunch. I knew it is gonna be busy, as it was the V-day + President's Day weekend. I made reservation through Opentable. But when I got there, I found out that reservation was only good for inside tables. Outdoor table was walk-in only. Well, we weren't too hungry and the wait was 15 - 30 min, so we waited. The tables were really packed, and they have a heater between every table which made it even more packed. People actually ducked under the heater to get to their seat, which could potentially light their hair on fire.The waitress was pretty friendly and we didn't expect too much given they were busy. The bread that they served was warm and fresh out of the oven. We ordered a French Onion Soup and the Soup du Jour, Lobster Bisque. They were both pretty good. Lots of cheese in the onion soup and they poured the bisque from a pot at the table. Then we had a Bacon Cheeseburger with Bleu Cheese and a Fish and Frites. They were delicious. The pommes frites side was one of the best. Oh, I ordered a latte, and it smelled and tasted extremely well.The ambiance, the food, and the service were not bad. It wasn't amazing, but I enjoyed it. It has a lot of potential. I might come back again for dinner. Hopefully, they won't be as busy.On a side note, there's the thing about people in Vegas. They are rather pretentious and trashy. The table right next to us was really LOUD. The women have big blond hair, and one of the men wore a cowboy hat. Guess where they're from. They were probably one of those people who would stand on the left side of an escalator. I could hear everything they said and I actually had to raise my voice so that my friend can hear me."
203,"This is as good as it gets. One of the best meals of my life. We were going to go to the paris buffet, but everyone wasn't hungry enough so opted for Mon Ami Gabi instead on a whim. BEST choice ever.I have never, ever had such flavorful Salmon, such tender roasted pork.But hands down what gives this place a 5 star rating plus my promise to my gluttony to always drop by everytime i'm in Vegas are two things:The savory, melt-in-your-mouth, filet mignon just lightly teased with butter and crushed peppercorns that is so soft and tender the cow must have lived on milk and honey and slept on a bed of buttered clouds its whole life.  The appetizer pan-seared scallops that hide succently in this gorgeous sauce that's soaked with the fragrance of garlic and shallots, draped along the sides with buttery, caramelized onions...the thick, plump, soft white scallops just waiting for me, delicately seared and sitting atop a bed of chunks of crystalized sea salt. oh God."
204,The service & food are outstanding.  Fantastic!!
205,"We reserved a table at the restaurant with Opentable.com. The reservation was honored and had a table at the patio as requested. A table at 7:30pm is like a balcony ticket to the water show @ Bellagio. We were able to watch the show 5 times while enjoying our dinner. Food was great. Started with the just-out-of-oven baguette and tasty butter. For appetizers, we had Onion Soup & Escargots. The portion of the soup was huge. For the first time of my life, I couldn't finish the cheese on top--must be a inch of cheese. Escargots was good as well. I decided to order the Roasted Chicken on my way to the table---looked good from the table around. The dish didn't disappoint me. Moist and tender, just the way it should be. The other dish was the steak with red wine sauce--good as well, but would order the strip steak next time. The service is great, especially for a bistro. Attentive and never rushed. The table in front of us was finishing their entree when we arrived and left with us. Great good, great atmosphere and great value.  A must stop in Vegas."
206,"Love this FRENCH restaurant & their outside patio.  After a night of debauchery in SIN CITY, definitely recommend to come here for breakfast before departing this scandalous city whom we all love!!  Make sure to sit outside if the weather permits; ""outdoor heaters"", baby!!!.  I was there in January and ordered their scrumptious eggs benedict and munching on countless FRESH BAGUETTE served with SOFT BUTTER while enjoying the view of Bellagio infamous ""water"" spitting fountain :)  I had dinner there back in 2004....bad memory, so can't remember what I ordered...solly!! Can tell you it was good if not, I would not be coming back every time I visit :P"
207,"Solid place - good food - nice people - eat outside if you can, you will thank me later,  would have gotten 5 stars if they had other than european wines on the wine list.   Perhaps we should have brought our wine?"
208,"This place is pretty awesome! Great outdoor seating with great views of the Bellagio water show.  I've been here for lunch and dinner.  The bread they serve you is warm and good.For lunch, tried the Sea scallops gratinees appetizer and this was soo awesome!! I could've ate the whole dish to myself.  Tender sea scallops filled with tons of carmelized onions and the sauce complemented it soo well! I love the scallops that were more well done with a lil burnt cheese covered on top... YUM!!Also tried the cheeseburger with brie, which was similar to any other burger.  The fries here were french style and super thin.  Not my thing since the'yre wayy too oily.The chicken and gruyere crepes were good.  The frisee salad it comes with is tiny though.  The dough is heavy, so I just ended up eating all the chicken inside, which was pretty tender.Frangria is just like sangria... nothing new here.For dinner, the salmon & spinach salad was good.  Decent salmon fillet.  Orange and grapefruit pieces went well with the salad.The french style steaks were awesome!! Large portion cooked to order! The steak bordelaise with onions and red wine sauce was soo good! The steak bearnaise was the same!  However, I wasn't as fond of this sauce.  Overall, the food is great!  Service was on and off.  The atmosphere was very nice, and the scenery was one of the best....  Watching the bellagio water shows in a french inspired atmosphere, what more can u ask for!! :D"
209,"Except for the long wait for an outside table (first come, first served - we waited 90 minutes), this was a truly memorable evening. It was the view of the fountains at the Bellagio that stimulated my interest in Mon Ami Gabi - after looking it up on Yelp, I made a reservation (not knowing that the terrace was not reservable). We did eventually get a table right at the railing, with a great view of the fountains. The food and service was exactly as described on Yelp! We started with the Escargots de Bourgogne - when we asked our attentive and very friendly waitress what escargots tasted like, she said ""garlic"". If you like garlic, this is for you! We used the remainder of our fresh bread to soak up the sauce. The bread and butter with a shaved carrot topping was grand. We also had the Butter Lettuce Salad, which was fresh and tasty. For main courses, we both had steak, mine was Steak Bordelaise, the other was Steak Roquefort. I got mine with the Frites, which were 1/4"" wide, paper-thin, and crispy. My intention was just to taste them, as they were highly recommended by our waitress, but I ended up finishing them. Sheryl substituted vegetables for her fries - she had garlic spinach which she loved. The steaks were good, thin and a little tough as French steaks usually are. No desert - too much food - but great coffee!! Overall, we went for the view and stayed for the food. A grand evening, not soon to be forgotten!"
210,"It's ironic that the sunniest, most pleasant place to eat a meal should be in Las Vegas, but so it is. Authentic faux-French finish to everything in the very best Las Vegas style, unoriginal American-versioned bistro fare (steak frite, mussels, steak tartare, seared ahi salad), mostly-french wine list with an unusual number of wines by the glass . The single best server to ever serve me served me here, and the single best oyster experience I've ever had I've had here. Three times.Wines are around $10 per glass, food is around $20+ per lunch entree."
211,"I had a great brunch with some girlfriends at Mon Ami Gabi last weekend. The mushroom crepe was amazing, but the ""salad"" they mention in the menu is actually less than a normal place's plate dressing.  Honestly, not a salad.  The French sangria (frangria) was good enough I got a carafe and finished most of it myself (although that could have just been the mood we were in).  We were seated outside with shade so weren't too hot or too cold and until some jerk started smoking towards the end of our experience it was perfect.  The waitress was clearly a pro and very friendly."
212,"ok you redeemed yourself.watching the bellagio fountain show at night, at this outdoor poopy french ""bistro"" at the Paris,  makes inhaling the sucky faux french food almost worth it...wish it was a thai restaurant, though. seriously...french food sucks. people with no tastebuds eat here, with glee...tee hee... bland bland bland... peuuuu...pepe le peuuu bland...oooh la la...oh look it's escargot dear..... isn't that like a snail? so what if it's uncooked and still crawling around on the plate...if it's ok with the french it must be refined...let's inhale a snail...& the pinot gris...whatever we can't pronounce...mmmmmm it's so rubbery and delish!note: wowwww, my diet soda was like dope dude"
213,"This place is a total steal! If it wasn't so cold, I would have loved to sit outside in the patio. I wanted a lighter dinner...so I opted to stay away from the steak. Instead I ordered fish. Then I realized it's a big fatty piece! Can you say big portions? I loved the tartare sauce for fries. If I wasn't so stuffed, I would have ordered the creme brulee. Must go back! Note: Do not expect to be seated if you just walk in. Make a reservation!"
214,"I had dinner here with my husband and some friends while in town for March Madness. The group size changed a couple times and the staff rolled with it and moved the whole table to accommodate the larger party.  And they were full with a long wait at the time.The waitress was amazing.  Several in the party wanted a glass of wine but didn't know what so were looking for suggestions (note: only French wines here, no CA ones.)  She went out of her way to bring over 4 different bottles of wine (opening 2 of them just for us) for them to taste.  And did it all with a smile.   I wasn't that hungry so only had the butter lettuce salad and the mac and cheese (macaroni gratin) on the appetizer menu but I LOVED them both. I had a taste of my husband's steak (Steak Classique) and it was delicious.  Everyone else seemed to thoroughly love their food as well.  We were too stuffed to try dessert - but I will save room next time!If you sit outside or near the front window, you can see the Bellagio fountains so that is very nice.I dislike most things French (cheese and bubbly are noted exceptions but really...still done better in CA) but this was quite yummy without the attitude at most French restaurants (yes, Masa's in SF I am talking to you.)I would definitely come back here on my next trip to Vegas."
215,"Almost as good as it gets!!! Very good steak frites and escargot. I recommend waiting a bit to eat the snails -- let them marinate in that yummy garlic butter sauce while you munch on some baguette.Our waiter was great. He was one of those detail-oriented guys. He was looking for spots on wine glasses and I even saw him straighten some forks on the table next to us. He was kind enough to write down the name of the wine for us.Great wine... Great service... We were seated immediately...Everything was fabulous, but it's still not as good as being in the Latin Quarter in Paris! Best escargot EVER!"
216,Nice cafe with a view of Bellagio's water fountain.  Service was just ok - didn't feel the waitress put in effort as we had a group of 5 and that's mandatory gratuity charged.  Good location and atmosphere.** Burger: juicy** Quiche: runny and too soft** Skate: good texture and size** Seafood stew: tasty
217,"I had my vegas moment here.  We had 9:30 reservations at Mon Ami Gabi, and we arrived at 9pm and were able to immediatly be seated outside on the patio with a table against the railing and were able to both sit so wer could watch the amazing views of the strip and the bellagio water show.  Our waiter, Chris, was there and attentive with a warm bagguette and a carrot salad that my girlfriend loved, I only got one bite.  Next Chris suggested a bottle of wine which was perfect.  We started with Duck Confit, which was amazing the tastes and textures were unbelievable.  We both ordered steaks which were perfect.  Here you can order the cut of meat then any of the sauces you want, these steaks were great.  and the frittes cannot be described you need to have these.We were not rushed through our meal, nor did we wait on any of the courses, Chris kept our wine glasses full and was very nice.  We savored our meal for 2 hours as we watched the bellagio water show 5 or 6 times, and the river of people on the sidewalk would be worth it to watch anytime.  This is hands down my favorite resturaunt on the strip, it is perfectoh and it was a little windy last night but the angles of the building and the heaters made it just fine to wear a short sleeved shirt."
218,"3 stars for the food, but I have to give it an extra star for the view of the strip!  We sat right on the patio and had a wonderful view of the Bellagio and of the attractive (and at times not so attractive) people walking by the strip!  The burgers here are good, but don't try the crepes--very flavorless!  I highly recommend ended your meal with a latte!  It was the best latte I've ever had!!!!"
219,"Went to Mon Ami this weekend with a group of 6 girls. We waited over 45 minutes to sit in the Pavillion area when we had reservations at 9pm.They sat us at a VERY small round table in the middle of the walkway, which was uncomfrotable. The patio door was open which isnt so bad but they also had the AC on blast. Helloo its almost 10pm and it was 60 degrees outside!Our waiter. Such a miss. I asked if Marlin was working that night and he wasnt ;( Our waiter was TERRIBLE. He was unattentive, flat out ignored us, took forever, wasnt professional and really didnt have a good persoanlity. Smile a little!The worst were the slow bustboys. They left us with our dirty plates for too long, reached across the table to serve food and lifted plates ABOVE my head to clear things away. Derfinately not ok in our book. The food was generally very good as always. Their special of fish in Saffron sauce was NOT good and we sent it back. Luckily that was refunded on the bill. Steaks, frite, and desserts (Creme Brulee and Flourless Chocolate Cake were VERY good). I will definately come again because its worth it. This night was just a miss because of the waiter. Next time, Im calling ahead for Marlins shift."
220,"I dined here for lunch last week with my wife during one of the few days there was sun out.  As I have frequently dined at the Mon Ami Gabi in Bethesda, Maryland, I pretty much knew what to expect - good food and service. (unlike my experience at Les Halle in Washington DC, where I had excellent food and an asshole for a waiter)  I can easily say that Mon Ami did not disappoint.After about a 20 minute wait, we were sat outside.  Immediately, fresh bread was brought to our table and our drink and food orders were placed (when in France, order Kronenbourg).  Our food arrived promptly. I had the mushroom quiche which I thoroughly enjoyed an my wife had the chicken and gruyere cheese crepe, which was tasty as well.   The restaurant is also across the street from the Bellagio, so we were treated to two fountain shows (one of which was Frank Sinatra...it doesn't get better than that). In all, a great place to enjoy an outdoor lunch on a nice, sunny day."
221,"I have eaten here a number of times (now it is a regular stop each time I come to Vegas). I can honestly say I have never had a bad meal and the prices I find very reasonable for what you get. By no means is this gourmet dining, but I do have to say it is as good as it gets for the price you are paying in Vegas. It is a lively atmosphere with a friendly waiting staff.The last time I was there, I had the flattened pepper steak and their Steak frites (I cannot remember the exact name off the menu) with a side of green beans. That was plenty for me. They have a very nice selections of wine by the glass, and again, fairly reasonable. The service is great and I  strongly encourage anyone coming to this restaurant to have a reservation as there is a line up to get in and you will have to wait."
222,"First time visit last weekend. We were a party of 18. I had the steak au poivre. OH SOO YUMMY! The sauce was to die for. THE FRIES.. you have never had fries like this.. and they went so well with the sauce. Someone ordered the muscles and the sauce and the muscles were also delicious!The French baguettes they serve with your meal was great. WE had Different sides and all were good. We ordered a few desserts and also all were devoured..I conducted a survey of our party of 18 and everyone LOVED THE PLACE!The service was great too.Place is a bit noisy, though I am sure our party added to the noise!You can sit outside and have a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains!Bon Appetit!"
223,"Maybe I'm easy to please, but set a generous portion of duck liver pate in front of me and I'm a happy, happy girl.  Give me a perfectly cooked (medium rare) steak with garlic spinach and whipped cauliflower and it's over...get out of the way, I am eating my ass off.  Oh, a little duck breast appetizer? Why thank you very much.  Your delicious entrees go for a reasonable $23 on average??  For a fancy restaurant, I think that's pretty good.  Me and my three friends split 3 appetizers, had 4 entrees, a side of spinach, bottle of wine and two beers.  I only paid $55 before tip, splitting the bill four ways.  Oh, and did I mention we saw Sig, captain of the Northwestern, from Deadliest Catch.  Yep, we did."
224,"If you can, sit out on the patio. From your table, you should be able to see the Bellagio fountain show while sipping bellinis.  We had to wait a bit for a table (lunch) but it was worth it.  The quality of food was outstanding...I highly recommend the quiche."
225,"Whenever I visit Vegas I ALWAYS make sure I go here!  They have such good food!  Kinda pricey, but worth it!  They have great food, great service!  If you plan to go, be sure to call ahead though and make reservations!  Ask to sit outside if you can!  Usually a longer wait, but again worth it!  Best time is during the summer months when its warm at night!"
226,"The food was great but I have to agree with Dallas H. on the service. Boo. The best service we got was from the water and bread girl. She smiled at us, told us what to order and was, with her limited English, much more helpful than our English-speaking server.Our waiter was incredibly haughty. Give me a break, dude. You know it's a problem if I leave a restaurant and have had only had one drink. The one drink I was able to order was very tasty, however, and it probably did Brian a favor seeing how I would not get in a taxi without a drink for our entire stay in LV (Read: Johnna was drunk for the length of our stay.) God, I loved drinking in the taxi more than anything. I even tried to bring my drink into Fashion Mall and Brian said no. Anyway, back to what you came here for.As I was saying the service was crappy. We weren't checked on at all, but luckily, the filet (once it finally came out,) was really, really, really fucking good and prepared properly. I even took a picture of it. They served it with some delicious crispy fries in a shape I've never seen-like thin fry strips. I would have loved these lightly drizzled with a vinaigrette or sprinkled with sea salt. They need to edit this side in some way to make it more special.Overall, our meals were absolutely delicious-but  the best steak we had in Vegas wasn't here... that bad boy was in another hotel restaurant in the Venetian. I'll be getting to that.Couples, this is where you go for some Vegas ambiance. Sit out on the patio at night in April; the weather is divine. If you get a seat on the street edge, you will have a full view of the Bellagio fountains-unless you are seated at the only table with bush right in front of it. WTF. That's OK. I got to stare at my sweetheart and the somewhat interesting male couple to my right. Unfortunately, we could hear Celine Dion from our table. This is why the waiter needs to bring me another drink, or at least check to see that we're still alive.OK, points to remember about Mon Ami Gabi:1. Sit outside, weather permitting.2. Bring a hot date/boyfriend/lover.3. Ask the busser/water girl what to order.4. Don't expect great service.Loved it, but can't get over the pissy service... minus one star."
227,"i'm a local and had never been so when out of town guests came to visit i figured i'd give it a shot - it was great all three times i was there (within a 2 week period) had lunch - croque monseiur (i'm sure i spelled it wrong) which is a french grilled ham and cheese - yummy! also had the duck leg confit, onion soup, filet au poivre (ok not all at the same time) and then had  breakfast on a sunday morning and sat on the patio which was fabulous -i ordered the chocolate and bacon waffle - i know sounds weird but the sweet/savory combo was fantastic....also, lots of hot fresh coffee.  so for a touristy place, it was reasonably priced, the service was good and so was the food - plus the people watching can't be  beat...give it a try - its not Paris, France but it's pretty close."
228,"The food was is the 3.5-4* range (and come hungry, because there is a lot of it), but I'm docking you major marks for some seriously bad service. We were super rushed and the attitude from our waiter was a pain (look if you can't even fake a smile, maybe you should go home). By the end we were happy to get out of there. Too bad, because I loved my scallops and I liked the french onion soup even it was too heavy on the gruyere (hint: layer of cheese on the top, not 50% by volume)."
229,"We went here for dinner and it was great, the service was spectacular as was the meal and appetizers.  Very good selection of wine as well.  The roast chicken is highly recommended."
230,"Love it...kinda fakeishly Parisien...:Food - 4  starsService - 4 starsPerformace/Cost - 4.5 starsDefinitely the kind of a restaurant that I'd like to spend my Friday nights.  We made a reservation for 7pm and were seated right away.  We had requested the outside seating but actually wanted to be inside since there was too much construction outside right next to Bellagio.  But we were seated just inside with a tantalizing view of the Bellagio and the water show.  Sweet.We started the evening with some cocktails, shrimp cocktails, and some pate, just enough to get us tipsy and get hungry for the steak.All three of us order steak frites - mine was perfect, the hanger steak was perfectly cooked to medium and the fries were excellent.  We took in a bottle of 2004 Silver Oak Cab with us...a beautiful complement to our steaks.  We had to run out since we were in a hurry to make it to our show, but it was a wonderful experience.  I'm shying away from giving a 5 since the presentation of the food could be better and the restaurant was a bit loud.  But it's a French bistro, what more can I expect?I'll definitely be back here for more!"
231,"Location, location, location. When we came here Thursday morning I was lucky that I made a reservation for breakfast with outdoor seating which by the way oversees the Bellagio fountains, unfortunately at that time in the morning the fountain show did not being but it was still nice to see the Bellagio and people watch. Ok, now to the food. I ordered the eggs Benedict which was really good. I had mentioned it before that for me what makes a good sandwich is good bread and this was gooood bread. The side of potatoes was just ehh. To wash down the Benedict I had a mimosa which was nothing special but it was suited the moment, Vegas 85 degrees (ha it was 9am) with great company in a great location. The service was great we never had an empty cup of coffee and I mean NEVER. The wait staff was very accommodating with any questions we had. Next time I would like to come here for dinner with outdoor seating. For that I would probably have to make reservations a week in advance. When walking by here at night it was jammed packed at night."
232,"Okay, so I'm probably not a prime candidate to make an interesting review of Mon Ami Gabi, but what the heck... the reason being is that I had their cheeseburger... it was awesomely awesome!  Some of the other items had at our table were, fish, filet mignons, chicken, vegetarian and salad.  Everyone said that they liked the food and the presentation was great!  My burger was really tender and cooked to perfection, the bun was tender (a bit big), I had mine with gruyere cheese and that was a nice touch and added some great flavor.  The main reason that I wanted to write this review is to rave about the fries (or frittes I believe they're called)... they're the craziest thing ever!  They were like a hybrid of a french fry and a potato chip, but soft, yet crunchy... I can't even explain it, they were so good I could have had a meal just entirely of those!  I also did try my wife's hanger steak and it wasn't too bad either, tender and juicy for  sure!  Their menu was smaller and not a lot of dishes that stood out to me... I really didn't give it a thorough read over, because I was in the mood for a big ol' juicy messy sloppy burger!Overall, really cool atmosphere, nice and friendly servers/waitstaff  and excellent fries....."
233,"So i have to give it to this place,Just a Great View and Location on the Strip.I tried their Egg, Bacon & Cheese Crêpe and my V. had their Eggs Benedict.The Crêpe was alright,but the egg was somewhat runny,i do not mind since i like my eggs sunny side up,so go figure me not saying anything,besides that my meal was alright.I do have to say their Eggs Benedict is really good,tried a bite and it was delicious,enough for me to go back and try it all for myself.Had a few rounds of Mimosas,they were real good.Now here is something that some Yelpers probably deduct on the stars,but i have to admit that at first i thought of saying the hell with this place,but they took a while for them to give us our first round of Mimosas,and their excuse was they ran out of Fresh Orange Juice,cough,yea,really,come on,be better then that,now i did hear that they recently offer breakfest,not sure how true that is,but i gave them the benefit of the doubt.Our server was #22,no name tag,just a number,huh? yea,so anyways,this guy was okay,that is why i say server and not waiter,cause he hardly waited.Now the best part besides the Eggs Benedict and Mimosas was OSCAR!,he was the Busboy that took care of us,and was really funny and outgoing,great person,i just wish they had more people like him there.We did get to see the explosions from the Bellegio,i am sure it would be more awww if it was night time,since this was 10am,it was alright,sorta cool.The whole experience was really nice...So if you find yourself in Las Vegas and near the Paris,try it out for yourself.I hope you dont take me to be snobby,but service should be great service especially in Las Vegas and at this resort.Just saying,i dont want you to trip on serving me,but come up with a better reason then we ran out of O.J. at the bar...Just saying,still a fan though,so takecare now."
234,"good mushroom omelette. Great bloody mary bar.  Selection of vodka + pickapepper, louisiana green wasabi hot sauce, some other good one i'd never tried, worchestershire, too kinds of mix, straight tomato and some other premixed (with anchovies!) very good, asparagus, celery, red and green jalapenos, olives, horseradish, pickled ginger, salami sticks (no thanx for me but you might like!), tomatos etc.  Only missing: green beans, lemon (for a small squeeze on top) and cocktail shrimp.  Outdoor dining available but get their early or tip for a table!  give this joint a try. also in Chicago (and perhaps elsewhere).  At Paris Hotel & Casino."
235,"As Peggy Hill observed in her neighbors backyard hot tub while eating cut squares of american sliced cheese, ""This must be what Paris is like.""Just kidding. I like this place though. I had the steak frites with bearnaise sauce. Very delish. The frites were just the right amount of salty and crispy. Baked cheese appetizer was warm and cheesy and pretty amazing. We sat on the inside (to avoid the 1 hr wait to sit outside), but they sat us literally 10 feet from the open windows with our chairs facing out, towards the Bellagio water show. Great service and pretty decent prices for Vegas.  Am now curious to try lunch there..."
236,We go here every time we are in Vegas! We love to sit outside and watch the people and fountains. The food and wine is always good. This time I had a simple soup and salad - French Onion was excellent and the salad was the blue cheese on frissee that was okay. I ordered a white Bordeaux - my favorite white - but they had to substitute the wine and it was just okay. This dinner will take about 2-3 hours so enjoy the time and scenery!
237,"I came to Mon Ami Gabi with a local restaurant manager who knew people so my experience may have been better than average.  Our meal was perfect, our service was great, and our prime seat outside at the railing on The Las Vegas Strip made the scenery priceless.I didn't order.  Neither did my friend.  We just let the waiter take control.  He brought salads, appetizers, and delicious steaks all paired with various wines.  This was very nice because I certainly don't go that deep normally.  And then there was dessert...everything was perfect.  The only thing they didn't provide that I could have used was a complimentary Rascal scooter to help me back to the hotel.  I was stuffed.I came back for drinks a 2nd time and had a nice experience at the bar.  The place as a whole is more on the formal side, but I went in casual attire once and didn't feel uncomfortable.Mon Ami Gabi (Moan ahmee gahbee is how I say it) is located inside the Paris hotel.  It is toward the front of the property, but you cannot enter from The Strip.  You must walk into the casino to gain access.  Don't try to jump the rail outside if you have had too much to drink as that would be tres uncool.  The outdoor seating is unique and is highly recommended unless it is during the day or raining.  I went on a hot night and sat outside, but didn't feel hot.Park for free in the hotel lot if you have a car."
238,"This is the very first restaurant I dined at while in Vegas; we went on a Monday night around 8pm and while there was a 30-45 min wait for outdoor dining, there was no wait time for inside (so of course, being starved from traveling, we opted for the quickest way).  They start you out with very tasty crusty bread and butter and a coleslaw-type salad which is very refreshing.  I ordered a special lemon tarragon halibut which was fantastic, and my friend ordered a salad with salmon and citrus (she said that it was very delicious with a nice large portion of salmon).  Our waiter was very attentive and my water glass was refilled very quickly.....I will definitely eat here again, as I REALLY want to try the steak, and hopefully next time I will be able to sit outside and watch the fountain show @ the Bellagio :)"
239,"I've been to Mon Ami Gabi three more times since my initial review and this has definitely become my go-to restaurant when I'm in Vegas and I want a guaranteed good meal for a moderate price. If you can, I highly recommend dining on the patio - you can't request it when you make a reservation, but when you check in, they will ask. My favorite dish is the sea scallop dinner - I've had it twice and it has not disappointed. The scallops are always cooked perfectly and you get six. The scallop appetizer was fine, but the entree is by far the better choice. The baked cheese appetizer which I had this past weekend when I dined at Mon Ami Gabi with two friends was a big winner with our group, but how can you go wrong with goat cheese and tomato sauce? I am not a big dessert person, but the chocolate mousse is amazing.Service is always very friendly and attentive. When my friend's steak on Saturday night wasn't cooked exactly how she wanted, our server got it taken care of right away. Before tip, I always seem to spend around $40 which includes wine (either a glass or a portion of a bottle), my meal, and maybe a portion of dessert. I never leave disappointed and will go back to Mon Ami Gabi on another trip."
240,"HANDS DOWN, THIS is my favorite restaurant in all of Vegas & it has been for years. I've been coming to Vegas since I was a bump in my moms tummy. So no I don't really categorize myself as a tourist. I've been to several restaurants and I gotta say i LOVE this restaurant. My love distribution is 80% location and 20% food.This is possibly the BEST LOCATED restaurant in all of Vegas, if you're a people watcher. It's a classy restaurant right in front of Paris LITERALLY ON THE STRIP, facing the Bellagio water show. You have the option of eating indoors (being boring) or outdoors (where all the action is) on a semi-elevated platform/balcony where all the tourist are walking and passing you by. It's exactly how several restaurants are in real Paris, which YES I have actually been to FRANCE. The only difference is that you watch all the crazyness of drunken pedestrians/traffic, watch the singing water show across the street and watch the advertising trucks with pictures of almost-naked hookers. It's great! lolThe food is pretty good and pricey and that's fine with me. It's mostly different types of steaks and frites. The drinks are pretty strong as well. The special cocktails they make aren't so strong, so just order your regular drinks like you would at a normal full bar. You're bill could possibly freak you out at the end, which it always does with me.If you want to impress a first-timer in Vegas, this is definitely the place you wanna go. You get good food, enjoy the freak show of people walking or driving on the strip AND they have great views of the strip which is good for pictures.I can go on about this place forever..."
241,"Wonderful experience. We decided to go to dinner last minute before the 10:30pm show of ""O"". We tried to get a patio table, but it was a 30 min wait. So they gave us the next best thing: table bordering the patio. It was an awesome view, I would say it's better than being out on the patio. We just went this past weekend and it was unseasonably cool and pleasant for Vegas. Bellagio fountains and weather made for a great dinner. We had the escargots to start. It was decent, I say too much butter. I had the bone-in ribeye with a side of Macaroni Gratin. The steak could have been more flavorful, but still good. The Mac gratin was very good. Service by Matt was good as well. The restaurant has a great ambiance and that's what makes this place. Go, the food is decent and the view is unlike any other."
242,"WOW, This place is amazing, especially at night with all the lights. Great for a date or with friends. You get a great view of Bellagio's water show. Man, talk about romantic. The service is great, maybe because my group had an awesome waiter... (apparently he DJs on the side)! Shout out to him if he reads this! So they provide a baguette to munch on while you wait for your food. The fries are great because they aren't your average fries. They are cut differently and lightly salted. MMMM good. I'd highly recommend the trout grenobloise. I am lactose intolerant so they customized it to my dietary restrictions. And it was still delicious!!! My friend had the pork tenderloin. Boy was it tender! Again, I'd recommend the trout and the fries. Surprisingly, this place is pretty affordable considering its smack dab on the strip. I'm a frugal person so to spend 19 bucks on dinner... I can't complain. Plus the portions are pretty generous. So this place does deserve the 5 stars. I hope to come back here soon or at least hope that they bring it out to San Diego!"
243,"Gabi, you can be mon ami!My friends dumped the responsibility of picking a dinner place on me (whoo hoo..) - thank you eavesdropping taxi driver for suggesting you, Mon Ami Gabi, at the Paris.  You have steak, seafood, salad, soups.. perfect!And, you were a good choice!  Everyone loved their food.  Two of us had the Halibut special, one of us got the Steak Au Poive, another the Steak Bordelaise, one order of the Roast Chicken, and an order of the Thyme-Seared Salmon (which, I would totally recommend, it was delicious!).  I don't think anyone left any food on their plate.  The only thing I was disappointed with though, is your French Onion soup.  You're a French restaurant.   French Onion soup is, well, French.  Oh, how could you mess that up?  Good thing it was one of the first things I had, so that I could forget about it when I dove into my main entree.Other than that, the view of the Bellagio fountains and your not-so-crazy prices, make you worth eating here."
244,"Walked in on a sunday night without reservations and had an AWESOME table!  ( we we're not outside but sitting right at a huge open Window with a mostly unobstructed view of the bellagio fountains)the service was awesome - the waiter was great, always had a smile and always realllly attentive, I loved that!The food : it was a mere "" Meh!""  Although, i would like to come back and try something else. I had a New York strip - didnt really like the crispy potatoes they were served with, the macaronni gratin was way too rich, and the steak tasted like a shoe!! I think theses people rely too much on their "" sauces"" and dont really give much thought to the actual  beef.Thankfully, i ate almost a whole baghette before the steak came so i was satisfied!! lol. Next time I visit this restaurant it will be for  lunch , and ill try a burger or sandwhich. 4 stars for the service, the ambiance and the service and the service! definitely will be coming back..."
245,"There's really one thing that makes this place - the patio, which is right across the street from the Bellagio. It's a perfect dining spot. The one thing to keep in mind is that the patio is first come/first served, so you may want to stop by just before (or as) they open if you don't want to sit around waiting.Fortunately, the food is also very tasty. Both times I've been there I had some form of a steak, which, of course, is served with fries. The fries are cut very thin, very crispy, a tad on the greasy side, and oh so very tasty. Spend the extra few dollars for the filet rather than going with the normal strip steak they serve.The service is very solid - very good, quasi-high class but not snooty.And for the location and food I think the prices are rock solid. Just a few dollars more than the Outback down the street.Whenever people ask where to have dinner in Vegas I always recommend this place."
246,"Great for Breakfast too.  The service was the best I had on my whole trip and the breakfast so yummy. I couldn't stop eating the toast. It was the best toast I have ever had. Big thick slices.  Even the jam was like homemade. I know it is only toast but it was so good. I had the Eggs & Beef Bourguignon, bacon, mushrooms, pearl onions for $11.50. The eggs where pouched and huge. I think they might have been duck eggs. Very rich dark yokes like free range grass feed poulty give you. The stew was very rich and tasty. Coffee is great and my server was always there to fill it up. I also ordered the flaky Pain Au Chocolat for $3.50.  My husband had the made by scratch blueberry waffles for $10.95. He said they where the best he has had. Looking at other people plates made me wanting to try it all. Next trip for sure."
247,"another great experience here... yummy bloody mary... good crusty bread and real butter... I had the salad with poached egg, bacon, and house vinaigrette... I just wish I had more bread to sop up that yolky, vinegary goodness at the end... pom frites excellent.. oh also had the crabcake, very good with a really good cole slaw... (vinaigrette instead of mayo)... the atmosphere is really nice too, classy but not stuffy... our waiter was ok but we had another waiter coming over and joking with us, etc, so it made up for it."
248,"One of my go-to spots when I'm in Vegas.  Not too fancy, good food, nice outdoor patio right across from the Bellagio fountains.  The seafood crepes are awesome.  They technically are not on the menu for some reason, but they'll still make them for you if you ask.  My only complaint to the staff would be: Please turn off your gas-lit lights when it's 100 degrees outside and sunny.  I literally thought my face was going to melt into my delicious beer.  But I still love you."
249,"Just went this weekend.Made a reservation  for 5 through open table.The food was good.I had the escargots which were okay.... and the french onion soup , this one... delicious but a little bit too big?:)My friends had the chicken and the filet au proive... the french fries were really good.What I like the most was the ambiance, and the location.  We got a table close to the outside, it wasn't cold nor too warm.The best thing was their wine list.  We had 5 different glasses.  I had a sauvignon blanc and my hubby the pinot.... it was really good.I love escargot but it was a big disappointment, it was tender but the flavors were just okay.Will go back again. Make sure you reserve before you go.... if not you will be waiting and waiting...:)"
250,One of my favorite places to dine when I'm in las vegas and las vegas is like a second home to me since I'm here so often...The food is excellent but its the charm of the outdoor seating area with the awesome view of the bellagio water show at night that makes it so special...Defintiely worth a try...bon apetit!
251,"We had reservations for our party of almost 30 people for our 30th Birthday Celebration. They put us in our own room looking out at the Bellagio fountains. Couldn't have asked for a better location for our party. The leader of our group had negotiated a set menu for a very reasonable price (4 courses $65). For spitting out masses amounts of food, the food was Very Good. We had crabcakes for one of our courses that was definitely one of the best Crabcakes ever! Lots of Crab! I picked the scallops as my entree (over mashed cauliflower), other than the scallops being a tidbit over cooked it was really good. Dessert: Choc Cake = Awesome! Decent cocktails! Service was on point! Overall a Very Good Experience!"
252,"great restauant! food all tastes great. i had escargot, and some sort of seafood ensamble with pureed vegetable, i think it was scallop. it was super good. i came here with a large group of friends and everyone loved thier food. one thing that stuck out the most... THE FRENCH BREAD! lol all the girls ate it and asked for more and more. this place has the best outdoor seating in vegas next to LAVO! I like this place for casual dinner."
253,"Had breakfast there. Nice outdoor seating. Great view. Quite inexpensive. Was not packed at 11AM on Sunday, while many other breakfast placeses had very long lines.French toast was to die for. Definitely worth the money and beats any buffet as a breakfast option."
254,"I had a great lunch over the weekend.After a night of partying, I needed a place to relax and people watch. In the 100+ degree weather, we sat down to a nice lunch watching the fountains. The water mist helped keep the heat at bay.My hamburger was great. Service was great. Sitting outside was the best. Forget eating buffets 24/7 in Vegas. Their portions are big and the atmosphere itself is worth 5 stars."
255,"I took my wife and 6-year old to this place last week, our desired buffet place across the street had an hour wait. We were very impressed with the service, food, selection, atmosphere and overall value. We went on a Sunday night, 6 minute wait to be seated. I had the chicken dinner with asparagas-excellent! It was kid-friendly, the kids menu had a great selection as well. I highly recommend this place if your tired of the usual meals in Vegas."
256,"I love this place, me and the gf went here and it was awesome. We sat inside and the atmosphere was crazy. Just buzzing. We both had the classic steak frites and it was an awesome piece of meat. Next time I would love to sit outside across from the Bellagio. I put in the reservations that we were celebrating our anniversary and the waiter gave us a free cheesecake. It was an awesome experience."
257,"Yay for Mon Ami GabiService: 4.5Food: 4.5View: 5 (from where we were sitting)Portion in proportion to price: 4Decor: 4That's my overall breakdown for everything. What a great place! My boyfriend & I came here on our last night in Vegas. We requested outdoor seating and we lucked out with, what I think is, the best seating. We got the corner seating with a PERFECT view of the Bellagio watershow and didn't have numerous people walking back and forth right in front of us. We ordered the pate, salmon, steak bearnaise (?), french onion soup. Everything was delicious, very decent sized portions and very filling. I would go into more detail but I'm too lazy. Basically, you can't fail with any of these choices. The atmosphere was pretty interesting. Right when you walk into the restaurant, it's pretty dim and seems more like a romantic setting but as you walk toward the outdoor seating, the atmosphere gets more lively. Or maybe that was just my take on it all.Basically, this is a great place for a date or even for a group to come here. Sitting outside is awesome (but be sure to do it later in the evening when it isn't scorching hot)."
258,"I love it here! The best time to go is in the late evening for dinner, when you can sit outside and watch the Bellagio Fountain show and people watch as you are enjoying your meal here. The steak and fries are just wonderful here, and the service is attentive. The atmosphere is almost 5 stars in itself!"
259,"We were strolling along the strip and since nocthing else seemed to be open, we decided to give this place a shot. The one thing I loved about this place is that it is right across the Bellagio water show. That was lovely. The food here is good. Their baked cheese is to die for :) The waitress was really nice she even offered to take our picture after we were finished eating. Maybe we will be back."
260,"I love this place!! Context: I was visiting my friend in Vegas for a couple of days and she asked me what I wanted for dinner right before my flight out. My request was simple: ""Somewhere outdoors with a view of the strip where we can chill, drink, eat some good food and people watch."" Surprisingly, there was only one place that fit my demands: Mon Ami Gabi!Apprehensively we drove over to Paris expecting a wait at the restaurant that would damper the plans but surprisingly most of the outdoor seating was available when we showed up at around 5:00 pm. We got a prime seat outside facing the Bellagio. Picture this: sangria, setting sun, water show, slight breeze with beautiful weather. Ah...Vegas - you gotta love it.We ended up ordering the escargot (delicious) and the skate wing (kind of fishy flavored, a bit disappointing) to share. However, I gotta admit that the whole experience was not really about the food, more about the ridiculously relaxing and beautiful experience.So again I say: I love love love this place. Usually when I'm in Vegas I'm just too hungover and in pain and I'm so glad we stopped in at Mon Ami Gabi to just stop for a second, chill, and experience the good life =)"
261,"being a big fan of French food, i was really looking forward to eating here. maybe it was eating at 4pm, or maybe i was just not feeling the food that day. i thought this place was okay. i just thought it was nothing special or out of the ordinary, something i could've easily eaten in LA and didnt have to be in Vegas to get.started off with Escargots de Bourgogne ($10.50). was pretty good. dipped the bread in the leftover garlic herb butter.. yum! :) got the skate fish ($22.95) for my main course. it was good.. had capers, which i liked. it came with chips, which became soggy from sitting in the sauce that the fish was sitting on. the fish was pretty tender, but also a tad lacking in flavor. maybe that was what the capers were for? the reisling i had went well with the fish though.dont get me wrong, the food wasnt bad. i actually had a taste of my friend's pork tenderloin and it was REALLY good. it just didnt seem to live up to the hype that i'm reading here. keep in mind we also sat inside, so maybe that took away from the experience of eating on the patio and overlooking the strip."
262,"One of 'Vegas' few civilized spots.  Very good food, fair prices, great ambiance and nice views of the water show right across the Strip at Bellagio.Tip: No matter how long they tell you the wait is to sit outside, you can just walk out there on your own and sit at the outside bar."
263,Been to Mon Ami Gabi seven or eight times and love it! This is my favorite place to eat at the Paris. Even better if you are lucky enough to get outdoor seating - a great view of the Belagio water show.Highlights of the meal - the wonderful escargots... And the filet mignon in merlot butter. The merlot butter is so effin good - I promise it makes your steak unbelievable!!  Mon Ami is a must stop shop in Vegas if you are kicking it a Wei Pari...
264,"I've always been a fan of Lettuce Entertain You restaurants, and Mon Ami Gabi is no different.  Service and food is excellent and it is a pretty good value, considering (NY Strip for $30? That is about 20-50% less than most other steak places).  Decor is dim and French in style, and the view out the front leads right to the fountains of the Bellagio, which provide ample entertainment on 30 minute intervals during the meal. The food is delicious, definitely recommend the baked cheese appetizer.  Steaks were good, and when I asked for some fresh cut horseradish, that is exactly what I got, not the creamed variety that often arrives.A nice, clean, civilized restaurant in the heart of Vegas, not bad."
265,"Made reservations nearly a month in advance for dinner for 4, and looked forward to the experience because I had eaten here once before and loved it. But this time - yuk! First, server appeared before we had even fully sat down (I was still trying to figure out where to set my purse) and asked what we wanted to drink. Told her we needed a few mintues - bad move as she did not return for a full 20 minutes. We had chosen a bottle of wine and an appetizer for the table, but she refused to take the appetizer request until she went and got the wine! When she returned with the wine she proceeded to fill my glass nearly to the brim. This is a pet peeve of mine. When I spend $80 for a bottle of wine I want it poured correctly so that there is room in the glass to aerate it and develop the flavor.Anyway, we remind her of the appetizer we want and order our meals. Appetizer never came. Waited 25 minutes and salads arrived. Told her we never got the appetizer we ordered and she said, ""oh sorry, we won't charge you for it then"". Less than 5 minutes later the entrees arrived and she tried to take the salads away even though we had barely had a chance to touch them!We had ordered the steaks cooked ""medium"" and they came cold in the middle. Returned them for more cooking - another 20 minutes go by. Finally she delivers the steaks again and also the bill! We mention that we just might want to look at a dessert menu once we have finished the meal, so she runs right off and brings one to us.We try to eat the rest of our meal, while she continually visits the table to ask if she can take plates away and if we want dessert. When we do finish she is nowhere to be seen. We give up and pay the bill and go elsewhere for dessert.This evening was pretty much a total loss. Was embarrassed because I picked the restaurant and was telling my friends how good it was. I'll think twice before going here again. There's just too many good restaurants in Vegas to take a chance on this one again."
266,"It's my birthday and I want mussels - Mon Ami Gabi has them and off we go on a very hot Sunday afternoon.  We immediately ask if we could sit outside, and the hostess is quick to tell us there is no shade whatsoever if we choose to sit out there.  (Hmm...it's like over a hundred degrees today!)  So, we decide to sit inside, but as we are headed out, I notice a handful of people sitting in the blazing heat and we decide to go for it.  Smack dab in the middle of the patio and perfect for people-watching!It's a quick peek at the menu and we're set to go!  Waters arrive shortly, along with warm French baguettes and butter.  The bread and butter is SO good, and just so French!  Yum!Our food soon arrives:* Mussels Mariniere with frites ($21.95 full order) - Loaded with tons of onions, we start digging in.  One of my favorite things about eating mussels is the yummy sauce that comes with it, perfect for dipping warm French bread into!  What I don't like is finding the beard still attached to the mussel.  Sure, I can let one go.  But there were at least four mussels were I was spitting the beard out.  Yuck.  The frites are usually one of my favorite parts too, but I wasn't digging their version here.  It's more like deep-fried potato sticks  * County Style Pate ""cornichons, whole grain mustard, country toast"" ($9.95) - The pate was just okay, nothing spectacular.  You take a piece of pate and put it on the country bread, and take a bite.  Have a cornichon too while you're at it.  But it wasn't something that transported me back to the French countryside.Our waiter also forgot The Husband's Kronenbourg, which required a bit of reminding.Service was good in the beginning with our water glass being filled often and more baguettes coming our way.  Then I think there was a shift change because all of sudden we were forgotten about and we had to wave the staff down for more water and our check.  We also noticed that we didn't get any kind of dipping sauce for our frites, but noticed other tables automatically got ketchup.  I would have been happy with mayo!Overall, I guess I was expecting more - from the service and the food.  Everyone raves about this place, and I was left feeling underwhelmed.  The location is perfect, and if you sit outside, it's fabulous for people watching and the Bellagio water fountain show.  Perhaps I'll go again and further explore their menu."
267,"This is a definite stop for me when I am in Vegas. The food is delicious, the service is awesome and the prices are reasonable. The location is great since it is right across from the Bellagio Fountain. You have front seat views of the water show if you sit outside.  I've been here at least 5 times now and so far I have not been disappointed.The escargot is a must, especially if you've never had escargot before. I am not an escargot connoisseur but I find that it tastes quite nice with all the garlic and seasonings. The price is around $10 for a serving of 6 pieces.Also, their steaks are divine. I enjoy a good steak and they definitely know how to please my palate when it comes to steak. My sister had the salmon salad, which she thought was excellent.Overall, it's probably one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas."
268,"If you dine here at Mon Ami Gabi at Paris, Las Vegas, you MUST dine out on the sidewalk patio, especially during the warm summer nights.  The view was great especially at night when the Fountains of Bellagio are in full view from your table (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=KiY8oJ2G_sQTPIAxD1TT5Q). I had the hanger steak and frites (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw). The steak was cooked nicely and the frites were very good and crispy.  Not bad for $20.  I have to go back and try their other steaks in order for me to decide if they truly deserve that 5th star.  Pretty good so far though."
269,"What a lovely, romantic place!!! We technically sat inside for breakfast, but the way the restaurant is set up, the entire front is open, facing the street and the amazing Bellagio hotel, so you're also outside more or less. It was a gorgeous, sunny day, so that made the experience that much better. We had a yogurt parfait, eggs, bacon and chocolate chip waffles (a pms ing woman's dream!!), and toast. As you are sitting there, the Bellagio fountain show goes off every so often, and sitting down relaxing with a meal is the best way to see it. It was a great, romantic experience. The food was very good, and the waitstaff very impressive. They couldn't do enough for us. Would def recommend."
270,"My sister and I stayed at Paris and ate here several times.  We had breakfast our first morning there on the patio, dinner take out another night and sticky buns to go another morning. Best patio on the strip hands down!  It was shaded from the sun, had a front row seat to the Bellagio fountains and misters to cool you.  The food was great.  Bacon waffles with chocolate sauce, ahi tuna burger and turkey avocado omelettes all delicious.  Only bad thing was the sticky buns, they didn't live up to the hype..a little dry. Service was great, very friendly.  Atomosphere was quiant- didn't feel like a casino restaurant at all.  Would go back in a heartbeat."
271,"As I sit here watching Andrew Zimmern eat snails in France, all I can think about is Mon Ami Gabi.It has become a birthday tradition; every year, I go to Mon Ami Gabi.  Twice.  Once with my brother, who, if possible, is even more of a Foodie than I am.  Then one more time with whomever I am in Vegas with (ex-husband, friend, friends......random stranger I met at Peppermill). I've tried almost everything on their menu (including things that they don't have any more and need to bring back, like the arugula and goat cheese crepes), and it is all phenomenal.   In order of how much of a food-orgasm they give me:1.) Escargot.  I've had a surprising amount of escargot in my life, and this is the ish.  Buttery, garlic-y, AMAZING texture; one order is often not enough.  Because my baby bro and I love them so much we sometimes get two orders.2.) Crepes.  Ohhh...the crepes.  One birthday, I did the double trip twice in one day; brunch the first time, late dinner the second.  The best crepe of my life was here, the aforementioned arugula and goat cheese crepe.  I had never had arugula cooked before, and its peppery flavor was perfectly complimented by the very mild and creamy goat cheese.  I have never seen it on the menu again, and every time I go I ask for it and everyone claims to have never heard of it.3.) French martini (vodka, chambord, pineapple, up).  No brainer.  They do it better than anyone.4.) Frites.  Ohhhhhhhhh the frites.  Crispy.  In large quantity. Their steaks are great, try one at least once, and I recommend the Dijon or Bordelaise.  I'm not saying it is the best steak I've ever had (Morton's tied with a random place in Kansas get that award) but it is REALLY good, and their sauces are incredible. You can make reservations online which is very helpful for weekends and busy evenings.Make sure you ask for a spot on the patio so you can have the perfect view of the Bellagio fountain. The covered part of the patio is well air conditioned during the summer and well heated in the winter.  The uncovered part has heat lamps in winter and is near nice little spray misters in summer (they don't spray on you, but somehow help keep the air cool near you).The servers don't wear nametags....just numbers.  Why? ""We at Mon Ami Gabi think the experience should totally be about you....our names don't matter"".  I do find this a little silly, because, by drawing attention to the fact that you don't wear nametags by wearing numbertags, didn't you just make it about you?  But having a server tell me about the jokes they make in the kitchen for certain servers (#69 gets quite abused), I find it fun and hilarious. I wish they had ranch.  Dipping my frites in mayo is not appetizing.If you haven't tried it yet, go.  And go hungry.  Ask for an extra baguette to take home with you.  Eat as much of those carrots that they serve with the bread (on good days) as you can.   Have a martini.  Pretend you're in Ocean's Eleven.   And eat some extra escargot for me."
272,"For my wife's birthday we decided to do something special and Mon Ami Gabi definitely provides a great romantic atmosphere and nice affordable dining.We arrvied about 9am and there was NO wait we were immediately seated on the outdoor patio and we were served right away.We ordered coffee, smoked salmon platter & bagel,Eggs & Beef Bourguignon , Chocolate-Bacon Waffle and a side of hashbrown potatoes(not pictured)The food was fantastic! The Beef Bourguignon was reduced in a red wine sauce with the MOST tender beef EVER. The Chocolate-Bacon Waffle with chocolate syrup & whipped cream was scrumptuos too!!!If you are looking to impress but NOT break the bank @MonAmiGavilv is the Place!!"
273,"I had my birthday dinner here with a few friends and it was pretty good.  We had reservations and as soon as most of our party arrived they promptly seated us.  The waitress made a few appetizer and entree suggestions that were very good.  After reading all the yelpers saying that their steaks are hands down one of the best things there I just had to try.  I'm not much of a beef eater but taking a leap of faith I ordered the Filet Mignon with Merlot Butter Sauce.  Oh boy it was melt in your mouth delicious!  The sauce was just perfect , the sauce was in no way overwhelming and it was cooked to perfection.  It was served with potatoe frites (similar to shredded potatoe chips, not thick as french fries).  We also ordered the Escargot and bake cheese as appetizers.  I love cheese and their baked cheese had this tomatoe base mixed in with the creamy cheese.  If you love tomatoes and cheese it's really good with the bread.  The Escargot were baked shell-less with a wonderful olive oil pesto sauce.  It was just yummy.  After all the Escargots disappeared I had an idea to dip my bread into the pesto sauce that was still in the pan.  For Dessert we had the Banana Foster Crepe.  It was big ennough to share and was wonderfully delightful!Things to try:-Escargot-Baked Cheese-Seared Scallops served with Cauliflower puree (taste just like mash potatoes almost)-Hanger Steak (If you don't mine chewing a bit and a little gamey)-Filet Mignon with Merlot Butter Sauce-Crab Cakes-Oysters on a half shell-Creme Brulee-Banana Foster CrepesThe servers were very polite and if you want to try out their oysters, they actually give you a sample of one before committing to a full tray of them."
274,"We went here for our anniversary and all that matters is that my wife really liked it!The patio is worth the wait because of the view of the Bellagio water show and the weather is great outside in the summer when the sun goes down. Inside is darker and cold.The warm bagette is very good...with shredded carrots...well, it kinda grows on you.The warm brie cheese was very tasty and it came with roasted garlic cloves. Good thing we are married so we don't have to worry about scaring anyone off with our breath afterwards. It was a small portion tho.We both got steaks. Now one thing you should know is that a French steak is pounded flat like Carne Asada. It's not bad, but I like a thicker cut. The fries were tasty, but they lacked something.I know it's not a glamorous review, but I'm just trying to keep it real (about the food).I'd go back again because of the view, location and the fact that my wife loved it. If the atmosphere was worse, I'd probably pass.Note: It is a reasonably priced steakhouse compared to the $50+ steakhouses in Vegas!"
275,"End of June we came here with my husband and friends for dinner.  If you are coming in the summer  and want a great place to watch the Bellagio Water Show make reservations here at Mon Ami Gabbi.  Do come around 6 ish and you might get lucky with an outside patio sitting.  We got there at 6 and was seated outside.  The sun went behind Bellagio Hotel by 6:10 so it was great and we had great entertainment with the watershow across the street.We ordered the merlot butter filet migeon, french onion soup, and salmon salad.  merlot butter sauce was just yummy on the filet migeon.  The meat was cooked right, but the best part was the merlot butter sauce.  French onion soup was huge and my hubby and i shared it together.  My salad I usually get here was light and tasty with fresh berries.  Oh.... the baguettes here are hot and yummy.  They come with butter and carrot slaw.  Try it with carrot slaw...it brings out the flavor and it's great.  My girlfriend feasted on these baguettes the whole dinner with butter and had it as basically her mainOverall the food is good and the price is reasonable on the strip.  Would I come back again....absolutely!"
276,"French Steakhouse at Paris hotel with a view of the Bellagio water show? Sounded like a perfect dinner date! Unfortunately the only appeal to this place is the location, which is absolutely amazing being able to sit through the water shows every 15 min during dinner. The food? Not so much.We received french bread and butter to start, just standard hard bread, not warm at all. As an appetizer we had the Escargot, pretty good but only because it was heavily drenched in butter and a pesto that made eating snails tolerable.We also shared a French Onion Soup -- served in a nice deep ""pot"" of a bowl, good for 2 people. Looked tasty, but was somewhat bland. The broth had no bite to it whatsoever, no hint of Sherry, just tasted like normal beef broth with plain onions.. note: onions were not caramelized. Very subpar as far as French Onion Soups are concerned.The main course sounded so delish. I ordered the Steak Bordelaise (caramelized onions and red wine sauce) while the BF had the Steak au Poivre (brandy peppercorn sauce). I ended up liking the flavor of the Bordelaise much better, although both steaks were quite large and thin.. I don't know if French steaks are usually like this but it wasn't enjoyable whatsoever. Even a McDonald's burger patty is thicker than these steaks.. no joke. The pommes frites served with them are very reminiscent of potato chips.. not sure if all pommes frites are like this but they were just okay. $24 per plate? please.The bill came out to $82.. without drinks. I think their strategy is to have their guests mesmerized watching the water show and not care so much about the quality of food. Sorry, but, we noticed.Overall:Location - 5 starsFood - 2 stars= 3 starsand prices are a rip, even though this is Vegas, an $80 dinner can buy you way better stuff than this."
277,"The 3 stars is a push.  It was actually quite good, but the fairly poor service and bathrooms with a line-out-the-door in the casino, I had to settle at 3.  So let's bullet point:PROS:- Food.  The filet mignon was absolutely delicious, in some sort of merlot sauce.  I believe there was also the word ""reduction"" in it, which tends to add to the fancy shmancyness.  It was about $32, so me and the boyfriend split it.  It came with an interesting side - these crispy 'fries' that actually tasted a lot better than they looked.- Asparagus.  Infused with butter.  Nuff said.- The waiter was from SD and super cool.  Definitely a surfer/stoner type, and we enjoyed his company.CON:- There is no restroom in the actual restaurant, so have fun waiting in line with a bunch of drunk Cougars and the 20 something year olds waiting patiently on the outiside to pick out the ripest (drunkest, or bustiest, whatever was closest) one.  Kinda ruined the fancy French restuarant vibe.- The poor water guy spilled water essentially all over my placing.  He was nice about it, but everything I used that night was pretty wet.- Actual waiter was cool, but completely forgot that we had ordered a bottle of wine, and didn't even get it until after our steaks were served.Complaints are minor, and food was delicious.  If you're going to spend $30+ for a steak, I would neutrally recommend this place.  If that even makes sense."
278,"A trip to Vegas is not the same for me without a visit to Mon Ami Gabi at Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino. Love this place. The Pommes Frites - LOVE THEM. I get them EVERY TIME I come here. And that crusty bread they serve prior to the meal with the real butter...just give me champagne and I'm on cloud 9! Love the steak, mac and cheese side dish, lox and toast points, croque monsieur and madame...wine...just love this place! I usually ask to sit in the dining room that faces the Bellagio fountains (adjacent to the outdoor patio), so I can enjoy the view while staying in the air-conditioned room (I'm from San Diego...I don't need any more sun). I am missing those Pommes Frites already....going back in September (YAY) - can't wait!"
279,"I went with Robin L. so see her reviews for the Cons.  Like her, the waiter / food runner spilled water all over my place setting (pretty much the first thing that happened after we were seated) so everything within an arm's reach of me was wet.  But that aside, considering what I paid and what I got, I was definitely satisfied.  BF and I split the filet mignon with merlot butter reduction.. the steak also came with these crispy little steak fries that I didn't think I would like.. but they went really well with the sauce and the steak.  We also split some side dishes: french green beans and macaroni gratin.  Everything was really good.  Our steak was a little more cooked than what we asked for; we got medium-well instead of medium.  But it was still good.  And of course, the green beens were cooked perfectly and the macaroni gratin was absolutely yummy.  We also ordered a bottle of bordeaux which, unfortunately, the waiter forgot about until after our steaks had arrived.. but no serious damage was done :)My total share of the bill came to $40 (that's including tip).  Not bad considering I had filet mignon, two sides, and a full glass of wine.  I'd definitely be willing to come back, especially on those trips to vegas when I can't afford to pay $80 at craftsteak ;)"
280,"To be clear this rating is based on Breakfast and Lunch, not dinner.We had a pretty good breakfast here with all the ingredients appearing to be fresh and well cooked. The bread is just delicious and does remind you of genuine French baguettes which have such a unique taste and texture. Lunch was less than perfect. I chose Moules Marinieres which is one of my favorite lunch dishes (especially when served with real frites!). However Mon Ami Gabi fell short. The broth was way too creamy and while the mussels were decent you just couldn't get past the fact that a pretty basic dish had been executed poorly. The frites were also not great, they were in between chips and frites and that's not what you need when you order a classic item like MM. I imagine people who ordered Steak Frites on the bistro style lunch menu would be similarly disappointed.Unlikely I would try dinner here with Bouchon and Daniel Boulud in town."
281,"View of the Bellagio water show? Check.Expensive drinks that tasted like a peach gummy? Check.Air conditioning so cold I had to borrow my man's jacket? Check.A nice place open past 10pm when we really needed that? Check.I had a blast here. Our one night in Vegas we decided to make awesome in terms of food and drink. I had a tomato salad that tasted so lemony, it blew my mind. I suspect the olive oil on it was lemon infused. It was like crack. My scallops were also good, and my bf had a huge half a chicken that we couldn't get close to finishing.For dessert we shared a creme brulee, which was also yummy. This place and our fabulous hotel room upgrade really makes me want to go back to Vegas, and I didn't think that would happen, at all. :)"
282,"Great oysters? Check. Good bread? Check. I got the Quiche Lorraine and it was done perfectly. Throw in a Guinness and I'm a happy camper. Tasted my friend's Ahi Tuna Burger, which was also very good. Service was a little slow, but our waiter was training somebody, so... We sat on the patio and the weather was great; we were right on the border of the air conditioning inside and the heat outside. I'm sure that later at night it's fun too watch all the insanity of humanity in Vegas walk past."
283,"We went to Vegas this last weekend with the parents in law and we ate at Mon Ami Gabi for dinner one night and lunch/brunch before we left. I really like this place. For dinner I had the escargot, which were perfectly tender and in a great herb butter sauce that made them melt in your mouth. I had the steak frites, and it was a giant portion that I could barley finish. The service was great but not overbearing. For lunch we were out on the patio and could see the Bellagio fountains. Our server was great, and pretty funny too! I had the country style pate and the spinach and brie crepe. They were both wonderful. The parents in law had the soup of the day which was a cold apple acorn soup, which they said was fabulous. All around great place."
284,"Though I only had two appetizers, this place really hit the spot! Came here after searchin for a place to grab a lite bite to eat. And needless to say, it was right on!  The bartender was quick to rush me my tab after ordering my drink, until I asked if I could eat at the bar. She quickly obliged.  I asked her how the pate was and she said most like the chicken since it has a smoother consistency, and the meat was a little too chunky for most.  Meat pate it is! Good. Full of flavor. Nice texture. Not really like a true pate though. Still enjoyable. Came with cornichons, cocktail onions, grain mustard n toasted bread.  The frisee and bacon salad with fried egg was delish! The egg was cooked perfectly with a nice runny yolk!  The overall menu looks impressive, which I look forward to conquering in the future. And the prices are quite reasonable.  Nice wine list."
285,"No doubt about it -- this is my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas and, in fact, it might be my favorite place to eat in the entire country.I don't speak French or know much about French culture, but I love Paris and its tradition of long, lingering meals outdoors over glass after glass of wine.  Some French restaurants in America try to recreate this tradition, but none does it as well as Mon Ami Gabi.  I eat here every time I go to Vegas.If you go, you must get a table outside.  This will probably mean a wait of more than an hour, but it's absolutely essential.  Directly across the street from the Bellagio, you'll have front-row seats for their famous water show.  You'll also be sitting in the shadow of the famed Eiffel Tower (Vegas version), and it's a prime spot for people-watching.The food and the service are both outstanding.  Purists criticize the food for its lack of authenticity.  I can't speak to that, but can say that the food they DO serve is fantastic -- the chicken liver mousse is to die for, their steak roquefort is seasoned and cooked to perfection, and I absolutely love their light, crispy frites.  The wait staff is attentive without being obtrusive, and there's never an attempt to rush you away, no matter how long you've been nursing that final glass of wine.This place is perfect for both a romantic dinner for two, or a raucous dinner party of 12.  More than a meal, it's a dining experience!"
286,"Yummy and cute place...Came here with my mom, sister and niece based on high recommendations from hubby.  They had a sangria that was so tasty that my sis and I finished the whole pitcher!Their hand cut frites are to die for!  Like nothing I ever had.  Their steak with butter was not too bad.  Mom ordered the duck l'orange which she loved.  Niece couldn't stop talking about the french onion soup and escargots she had."
287,"YES. YUM.eff all that 'authentic' jazz. I don't particularly care if my bowl of Gazpacho is not traditionally French, it was DEE-LISH. As were my mussels, the steak frites, and the scallops. VERY well priced for the Strip; a classy little eatery. Total win, both for service and food. I could eat here for days. Yes, days."
288,"This place is very nice for breakfast. portions are also a very good size. waiter was extremely nice. I'm not a fan of breakfast food, but my boyfriend thought the waffles was very good. Since the food didn't wow me I give it three star."
289,this 1 star is for the service alone!  they wouldnt sit us for some f'ed up reason.  we walked in and were offered inside or out and when we said outside she said well its pretty sunny we said umm ok inside she then said it will be 15 minutes.  mind you there was not one soul indoors.  another 2 ladies walk up and got sat right away!  really?
290,"Thanks to Yelp and Mon Ami Gabi's great reviews, we decided to try this place for dinner. We didn't realize it was located at the Paris Casino right across from the Bellagio. We lucked out and got a table with a great view of the Water Show. They only take reservations for indoor seating, but outdoor seating would be awesome. Service was good and food was delicious! We ordered...Appetizers:Escargots de Bourgogne - very flavorfulCheese Plate - came with 3 different types, fruit preserves, nuts, apple slices and walnut raisin bread (which we asked for extra since there was still a lot of cheese on the plate when the first batch of bread was done). Was enough for 4 people.Main:Filet Mignon - literally melts in your mouth. Comes with frites.Trouth Grenobloise - great flavors. Fish was fresh.Dessert:Profiteroles - they were alright, but I think it's because I'm not really a big fan of profiteroles in general. Just FYI. Corkage fee is $20, but you can't bring any wine on their menu."
291,"It seems like the old vegas standbys of coffee shops and buffets are not what they once were, namely cheap and accessible. Its not that I loved eating at the hotel coffee shop, but it is what you did. Well thankfully this trip to Vegas I did not settle for breakfast, instead walking around the strip until I found the outdoor seating at the Paris hotel. It looked to good to pass up and it was. I ended up going twice, each time enjoying the eggs and bacon, an excellent roll with chocolate, and fantastic fresh squeezed orange juice. It was such a pleasant way to start the day, with people watching being one of my favorite Vegas past times. The service was attentive, our server walked to another restaurant to get us whole bananas. The smoked salmon my wife had was much cheaper then the hotel coffee shop and great according to her. I loved this breakfast for taste, value, and simplicity. Next time you are in Vegas and do not want to settle for breakfast, head to Mon Ami Gabi and have a seat outdoor along LV Blvd. and enjoy the fine decision you made."
292,"If you like butter, cheese and more butter, this place is for you. While the set-up is cute (if not a bit too kitschy) and the service is very pleasant, the food tries to be French but just hits you with as much fat/grease/butter as possible. I'm always one for unhealthy food, but this was a bit much.Starters:-Chicken liver mousse: Good, flavorful, huge portion-French onion soup: The broth was good, but it was so hard to get a taste of what the soup was like with the HUGE glob of cheese on top of the soup. Now, I love cheese, lactose-intolerant as I may be, but I had to scoop the last third of the cheese out bc it was just way too much.Dinner:-Roast chicken: This isn't the roast chicken of Bouchon, that's for sure. It was good but a bit dry...and the vegetables were so completely soaked in oil, it was hard to figure out what you were eating.-Skate: I love skate because it's such a nice, light fish...but again, I thouht I was eating a pound of butter mixed with some lemon and capers. The vegetable salad was a very nice accompaniment, though - very refreshing.-Macaroni gratin: I make it a habit to order mac n cheese at nearly every restaurant I go to, if it's available. This version literally had a pound of cheese on top; I was confused on whether there were even any noodles in the dish. Again, ended up scraping off 2/3 of the top cheese layer to even enjoy the dish.I think this restaurant has potential if they laid off the cheese/oil/butter and just let the food speak for itself. It's really not necessary to make America fatter than it already is!"
293,"I was very disappointed with my dinner here.  I thought 4 stars, 344 reviews - this place must be solid.  My pizza from a fast food place at the Venetian was more satisfying.Maybe I'm being too harsh as there were semi-positives to my meal:1. the french onion soup, which my server claimed was the best ever.  It was good, but I cannot agree with her claim.2. the french fries.  They were thin and crispy and cooked just how I like them.  I think I'm committing a faux pas by saying this, but I thought the fries here were better than the very famous Bouchon fries (which I tried the next day).3. the bread pudding.  Once again, my server claimed it was the best ever.  It was good, but not the best ever.  I love bread pudding and this stuff was just okay.  I've def had a lot better (the Nordstrom Cafe bread pudding is the best!)4. the oysters.  I didn't try these, but my bf said they were good and he loves oysters.However, the positives didn't really balance out the not so great entrees.My bf ordered a roasted chicken that was flavorless.  Don't offer roasted chicken as a house special if it's going to be dry and just not good.  I ordered the fish and frites (hence the yummy french fries).  The fish was disgusting.  It was pounded down and fried as like one large circle.  I took 2 bites and couldn't eat anymore of it.  Yuck!Perhaps we should have ordered something else, but I will not be returning to eat a meal at Mon Ami Gabi (I might just order some fries to go!).  Just like how I felt for Craftsteak, there are too many other dining options in Vegas to come back to this one."
294,"This is a really cute brunch place, and an excellent alternative to buffets if you so incline.  We stopped in Saturday morning (OK, who am I kidding, it was afternoon) with a group of seven and were seated promptly.One or more of us was definitely hungover.  Sat down, one quickly asked for orange juice.  And hash browns.  Cuz that's all he wanted.  The waitress must be used to this.  She put in our orders right away, and our food came shortly after.Spinach salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=p2jfy0rIunBvoGMqsrA6ZQ) and cobb salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=5OHXWa2Qm86xSMbqOisfVQ) were both fresh, with the right amount of dressing.  Good portion if you're not super hungry but feel the need to eat something so you're not starving an hour later.Hamburger with a fried egg on top (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=_ctKpcyf6wjYlIgGwuo87Q).  Amazing texture, cooked to order.  Comes with a side of skinny fries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=EUD7yxHWUcaiZVdUyqHY6g).The fruit platter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=PXCW7S7UC9YorPU9rRU-7A).  Pretty to look at, hard to eat.  Definitely hard to share.  False advertisement!The rest got the corned beef hash, with a side of hash browns (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=SMi354SDQZfhbITcvyufBQ).  Huge portions, but didn't stop any of them from wolfing it all down!Good spot to watch the Bellagio water show, too :)"
295,"The day after a superb dinner at Guy Savoy (getting in later than my friends who were in Vegas to ""party"" and still waking up before them) I woke up early - feeling great I went for a run outside, the first time I'd ever done so in Vegas - what they say about it being ""a dry heat"" is right and the mornings are dry and cool - running from the Venetian down to Mandalay Bay and back I was more dehydrated than I normally am on a run twice the distance.  Drinking plenty of water and showering I'd worked up quite an appetite and made my way out for another walk south on the strip - this time to Mon Ami Gabi at Paris.  Arriving at 7:20am I was greeted by the friendly hostesses at the door and led promptly to a prime seat on the patio where I watched Vegas roll by - the best part about early morning Vegas is that there are only two sorts of people - the early morning joggers and the people just heading home.  I laughed like hell when a guy came up and yelled ""high five - yellow shirt - I love yellow shirts"" with regard to my vintage LA Kings T.  Only in Vegas.Having heard much about Mon Ami Gabi's view - truly awesome sitting 4 feet above Las Vegas Boulevard and directly across from the fountains at Bellagio - I must admit I'd heard mixed reviews of the food and went in with tempered expectations.  Greeted by my server and handed a menu I was offered coffee which I graciously accepted.  A decent French Roast with heavy nuttiness the coffee was good, but probably the worst I had during my trip to Vegas...and refills were slow at best despite the restaurant being unfilled throughout my meal.  Browsing the menu I was impressed by both the sweets and the savories - deciding between the Blueberry French Toast and Poached Pear Waffles proved difficult and thus I ended up with neither.   Placing my order I also opted to order a pain au chocolate from the limited bakery menu.Sitting for nearly 30 minutes while I waited for my food I sipped my coffee and watched the street - I've said it before and I'll say it again, half the ""Vegas Experience"" is people watching.  Eventually arriving along with only my first refill of coffee (I had to request it - thankfully after this service improved and a young man took over my coffee refills) I was somewhat surprised when the sweet arrived with my savory breakfast.  Cool and questionably fresh the Pain au Chocolate was appropriately buttery and flakey but lacked any pizzazz.  Featuring a small single vein of average chocolate I could've gotten the same dish for much less than $3.50 at most convenience stores.Where I would consider the sweet a failure - I didn't even finish it - my savory at MAG was actually a unique take on a classic and quite delicious.  Described as a ""classic"" Croque Madame the dish was actually presented in a ""deconstructed"" fork and knife sandwich manner with two large slices of hearty grain bread pan fried in butter and then cut in half, topped with ham and gruyere cheese plus chives, and finished with a sunny-side up egg.  Accompanying the croque on the plate was a simple salad of frisee and vinegar and on a side plate were some oily and uninspiring (and decidedly American) hash browns with Heinz ketchup poured into a small cup.  While good this croque and accoutrements certainly wasn't as good as the version the previous day at Pinot and no-where near on par with the versions in Northern California at Butler and the Chef or Bouchon.Finishing my meal and sipping on my coffee again my female server finally returned to my table to ask if I needed anything else - when I asked for a ""to go"" cup of coffee plus the check this duty was pawned off on the young man who'd been filling my coffee while she went back to talking to the other female server near the register.  Like Pinot I simply don't understand why ""bistro"" entails sub-par service in Las Vegas and I actually mentioned on my way out suggesting that I wanted my tip (left in cash as opposed to on my credit card as I normally do on vacation) be given to the young man and not my ""server.""  In general I can't say there is much to brag about at Mon Ami Gabi aside from the view and while the restaurant would certainly stand at the top of French cuisine in Columbus Ohio (my home) I'd much sooner go back to Pinot, Bouchon, Payard, or Tableau when in a dining destination city like Las Vegas."
296,Did not like it the first time I went there.  Getting better every time since!  Give it a chance!
297,"My boyfriend and I ate here this past Monday. I've tried to eat here 3 times before but the line has always been too long. We were lucky this time and got a patio table facing the Belaggio fountain show (which went off every 20 mins). This restaurant is all about location, location, location. It was fun to people watch and take in the fountain show. The food is descent. We had a house salad, French onion soup (the best part of the meal), and a steak with blue cheese. Go for the patio and have a glass of the house Sangria."
298,"Ate there Jan 2009, Anyone who thinks this is anything like a french bistro is sadly mistaken. If you looked at the menu, it basically is a steak house menu, with fish and chicken for those who do not feel like steak. The only thing french about this place is the menu, which is in french, but a steak house menu, in french, is still a steak house.We made reservations months ago and when we arrived, the table was ready, but was right next to the waiters station and kitchen. Very loud. If I did them the favour of calling ahead that far, you would have thought I would have gotten a better table. If you want a okay steak, go here, if you want french, I'd pick up a copy of Rosetta Stone."
299,"This establishment is located in the Paris hotel, across from Bellagio. High volume is during the weekends for dinner. PLEASE try to make a reservation during the times of Christmas, NYE, and Valentines Day season. It will be very hard to get a walk-in. There is also many sections of the restaurant to be seated at. First room is the wine room, which is midly dark. Chose this room if you are there for drinks or for 'intimate' time. One problem is that it is near the front where people are walking in and out constantly. There is outside seating available, which faces the strip and Bellagio fountains. It is both good and bad, since some annoying tourist might bother you while you are eating. But the fountain show is wonderful to watch while outside. There is also a room that is inside but right behind the patio, so you get all the ambiance of the patio but you are technically inside.I believe I have eaten here four times. The first time was with a friend for lunch and both the food and service were excellent. We were walk-ins on a Saturday during lunch. We were seated outside facing the bellagio fountains, which was beautiful.  I had clam soup, brie & garlic, Shrimp Gabi and escargot. We also ordered the Pinot Gris, which was excellent with the meal. The price was reasonable for the quantity and quality of food we had (the bill came to about $120US). Everything was flavorful and fresh. Based on this meal alone, we would highly recommend this restaurant.Second & third time was with my friends (who are yelpers as well). The third time, we sat in the room behind the patio (since it was hot outside).  I basically ordered all the same things from the first visit and it tasted just as good. These times, were had ordered dessert, which was a vanilla type of milkshake. It was incredible. Fourth time, I will say I was disappointed in both the food and service. Perhaps cause one of the individuals with us was a friend of the assistant manager, and it seemed that we were being ignored or just not waited on as well as others there. The service at lunch was erratic and inattentive though the restaurant was not that busy than it had been at any of my previous meals. I wanted to try their Quiche and was not impressed. It was dry with very little flavor, and bland.  My boyfriend's meal was no better, which I believe was a steak of some kind. It was pretty dry. Even though we did not pay for this meal, the value was not nearly as good as the value the past few times. From my experience I would still highly recommend the restaurant. I have been to more expensive French restaurants and this place is honestly great for the price. Just do not be discouraged from one bad meal. I would say that  is a great ratio."
300,"My overall experience was very good. For a vegas restaurant, these prices are really very reasonable. You can pay more for a steak at many of the generic steakhouses inside casinos, and the wine by the glass is really very reasonable at 7 or 8 bucks per glass for their more basic wines (I had both a sauv blanc and a glass of gsm and both were good and recently opened). As for the food:I started with the sea scallops which were in a mussel cream sauce. Outstanding, though perhaps a touch too much Parmesan. That's not really a complaint though... just finding something to quibble about. I had their prime rib special which looking back on it was a mistake. The prime rib was fine though not outstanding and it was reasonable at 35 dollars. It was also too much food in the end when combined with my other dishes. The others in my party had salmon (i didn't get the verdict), the new york strip (judged good and the shallots very good), the crab cakes (judged outstanding), the salmon salad (good), as well as the french and soup du jour (a apple and parsnip soup). For dessert two of us had chocolate mousse. The mousse was exactly what you'd hope and expect. They topped it with dark chocolate crunchy things which are good, but unfortunately just put pink berry in mind for me because they have to be exactly the same thing. Another person had the peach parfait and was a fan of it. ---So I'd give this 4 stars. The food was very good, but not truly exceptional, which I think it needs to be at this price range to earn a 5. The service was very good, refills on water came swiftly, and the pacing was appropriate for a French restaurant (i.e. slow, but purposefully and not annoyingly so). Of course, mention has to be made about the atmosphere. It's really nice. I asked for a table with a view of the Belaggio fountain, and they made us wait about 15 minutes upon arriving, but they gave us a good table for it. It was very pleasant. I'd definitely suggest this restaurant. I think you could probably get a better meal if you stepped up a price category somewhat, but then you wouldn't have the nice sidewalk cafe feel."
301,"I went to Mon Ami Gabi as part of a wedding party for my best friend's wedding.  I along with everyone else thoroughly enjoyed my food.  The staff is nice and courteous.  They're a little slow with the water service and I had to ask for something a couple times as they would keep forgetting.  (I wasn't the only one who experienced this)  Although the Bride and Groom took care of the bill, they said that they were happy with the end result as everyone was happy and super full.  I recommend this place for a large group of people.One of the downfalls: There are no restrooms inside the restaurant.  You have to go out in the lobby / casino area to use the public restroom.  Fail."
302,"I don't know what they put in the coffee here, but it was the one of the best I've ever had.  Or maybe I was hungover.  I was in Vegas for a 4 day buddy's bachelor party extravaganza.  I did eat here for 3 straight days for breakfast (at 2pm).  I tried everything from the Eggs & Beef Bourguignon to Salmon Eggs Benedict.  The food was awesome.  My only complaint was that the pitchers of orange juice was ridiculously expensive.  The 4 pitchers of the orange juice was about 33% of the bill for 6-8 people.  Otherwise, the food price wasn't too outrageous.  The orange juice was phenomenal but not worth the price though.  We always sat on the outdoor patio with a great view of the Bellagio fountain.  The service was somewhat slow, but I'll give them slack because this place was always busy.  At least the servers were always super nice."
303,"I am a Vegas regular and I always make sure to include a stop at Mon Ami's every trip. My favorite is for their brunch - mmmmm so good! Their frangria (the french take on sangria, I guess) is my personal favorite for morning after aches. I've had the quiche lorraine, their grilled cheese and short rib sandwich, waffles, gabi salad and all have been absolutely delicious. Oh, and don't get me started on the fresh baguette they bring to your table. Man, that stuff is good! The service is always wonderfully attentive and they sit you promptly for a Saturday/Sunday brunch. I've also been here for dinner and the steaks are amazing, especially with the sauces they offer. Ooohh and don't forget, whatever you order, make sure to try their pomme frites - some of the best I've ever had!"
304,"NOTE: This review is only for breakfast.Beautiful indoor and outdoor patio seating makes this a perfect setting for a nice and relaxing breakfast or brunch. Their eggs benedict and florentine are incredibly tasty with surprisingly decent prices.I've only been here twice for breakfast, so I have yet to experience this place for dinner. So far both times there was no wait or reservation needed since it was outside of the normal waking hours of the Vegas crowd."
305,"Romantic weekend in Vegas with the lady friend and wanted to have a nice steak.  Walked into Mon Ami Gabi without reservations and was told by the hostess that if we sat inside the restaurant we could be sat immediately. I'm not really fond of the whole faux-Paris experience anyways and would never wait 3 hours for a table on the patio... because at the end of the day, you are still in Las Vegas not France... We were sat at a nice table by the window and began the evening. The staff and service was excellent... never once did we have to ask for anything.  Our server was polite and charming.  Placed the napkin on my girlfriend's lap and made sure the wine glass was never empty.   I ordered the Steak Béarnaise with frites.  A tender piece of flat steak cooked rare and served with a classic Béarnaise sauce.  I thought it was pretty good until I had a bite of my date's entrée and then wanted to cry. My girlfriend ordered the Filet Mignon with merlot butter and a red wine reduction.  Perfectly cooked rare and gave me a mouth orgasm that quickly spread to the rest of my body. I really like the frites here and I will submit a signed statement saying that they are much better than the fries at Bouchon. Hand-cut freshly made crispy deliciousness that pairs well with the steak.   These are my favorite fries. Washed it all down with a couple of glasses of nice Bordeaux. Flawlessly cooked Filet Mignon, tasty frites, and amazing red wine.... For a brief moment I felt as if I was floating naked in a hot tub on ecstasy...    It was a fantastique nightHighly Recommended"
306,"Affordable French restaurant! We were sitting in the ""Sun Room"" which is gorgeous! I love eating under sunlight w/o all those dust coming from the street... We went there for lunch and got seated really fast. Fresh oysters that we ordered that day was excellent, out-of-this-world good!!!! So fresh w/ slight sweetness.... We ordered a dozen.. couldn't have enough so ordered another half a dozen... The Escargots were not bad, really garlicky! My boyfriend has a chicken, brie, & spinach crepe, which was good, not very exciting though... The chicken was a bit on the dry side. I had the butter lettuce salad. Butter lettuce is my favorite lettuce =P I LOVE its vinaigrette dressing!!! It was light and tasty, YUM!Actually, if it wasn't for the oyster, I would probably rate it 1/2 a star less... Maybe we were just lucky that day..?"
307,"Wish i was with a man... but i was with my 40 somthing GF, we wanted good food.... so we decided to have a romantic dinner lolVery Romantic... perfect for couples!The food was amazeing.....our waiter was hilarious...he wass so sweet and cute..... he recommended the special of the night to  me... i went with that.... it was so really good!I will definatly return... hopefully next time with the oppisite sex!"
308,"Very crowded on a weekday morning, so we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table outside. We just went into the casino and gambled a little bit to kill time. Paris is a really cute hotel so it was really a lot of fun!Our buzzer began buzzing so we made it back to the restaurant, were seated outside, and began to eat outside faux Paris in this cute restaurant. I came here because I knew that when I was in Vegas two years ago that I went to a restaurant in Paris (not remembering the name), but definitely remembering the really good food. So I am back again (in the correct place) and the food was excellent! Excellent  omelette  with hash browns. Very tasty and good coffee too. I would definitely return, as the prices are not too bad and the food was VERY tasty. Gouda cheese is awesome in an omelette!"
309,"I can't say I had that great of an experience here, but it wasn't bad.  I came here with four friends, one didn't like her food and the rest of us were indifferent.  My friend and I ordered steak...I a New York Steak with Bernaise sauce....it was good, I was just not expecting the steak to look so thin and long...but I still enjoyed the steak and sauce...what I wasn't too crazy about was that they served it with a boat load of pommes frites.  Now that I know, if I go again, i will ask for veggies or something else on the side...I just don't think it went well with the meat...or maybe if there were less of them and more of something else..,but hey..maybe that's how they do it in France!  The waitress was nice and she was very helpful when my friend asked to put the bill on her players card...we found out that the restaurant is not part of the hotel so she had to go back out to the players card desk and ask for some kind of paper in order to charge the bill to the card...but it ended up working out...and it was just find.  Prob the only reason that would make me come back here is to get a patio seat and eat, relax, and watch the Bellagio fountains across the way."
310,"Had lunch here, food price was very reasonable for vegas and the atmosphere was great."
311,Excellent steaks served with very tasty fries.  Desserts are to die for.  Wonderful wine list.  Location is great.  We had a fantastic waitress.
312,"This is a great find on the Las Vegas Strip. Excellent food at very good value, compared with overpriced choices nearby. Good service too. Highly recommended & I will definitely return when I come back to town"
313,"I have been here twice.  Both times, amazing!  The food is creative and tasty.  I especially enjoyed the sangria with rosemary.  The view, overlooking the fountains, could not be better."
314,"Dined here on a recent trip to Vegas.  Just walked in - no reservation - no problem!  We sat inside - it was too clammy outside for me.  Service was great, food was fabulous and the wine was divine!  Cant wait to go back."
315,"My first time eating here was in '07, even though we have two Mon Ami Gabi outposts in Bethesda and Reston back home. However, for some reason Mon Ami Gabi in my area doesn't get half the kudos that the Vegas location does.In any case, our first night in Vegas lead us back to Paris. We were here on October 29th and were able to secure a table without reservations. There is outdoor seating available, which is great for people watching, but as it was kind of nippy, we opted to eat inside. Our server, according to my receipt, was Dia, who was cute, knowledgeable, and provided excellent service. I ordered the Steak au Poivre with brandy peppercorn sauce, and my friend ordered the Filet Mignon with merlot butter and red wine reduction. Now this is where I should really listen to my friend and heed her suggestions, as she is from Oklahoma and girl knows her beef. While my steak was good, the steaks here are cut real thin. I ordered mine to be cooked medium and truth be told, when it's a thin slice of meat, you are better off asking for medium rare. Her filet mignon, of course, tasted better than mine since hers is a better cut. The generous portion of fries are hand cut and also sliced thin, fried very crisp, and are reminiscent of the won ton crispy noodles you get when you order soup at Chinese restaurants. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you want your fries to have some taste of potato, then you are best off ordering one of the side dishes. We had also ordered a carafe of sangria (billed here as ""frangria""), and we both agreed that it is one of the better sangrias that we have ever tried, and one of us has been to Spain. At under $16, it was enough to provide a nice buzz and was cheaper than getting multiple cocktails or ordering a full bottle of wine. They do have wine by the glass, and if you are here in the fall, you can't go wrong with beaujolais nouveau. We didn't even have to pour it ourselves, as Dia was always on the mark and filled our glasses when it got half full.For dessert, my friend ordered the warm chocolate tarte tatin with caramel sauce and whipped cream. I got the pear parfait with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. With tax, my portion of the meal was $34.48, excluding gratuity. I can definitely recommend this place, as it was fairly inexpensive, but the amount of food, plus the service, makes for a great value. If you're not in the mood for dinner, try having dessert out on the patio with sangria, wine, or cocktails. It's a good way to start (or end) your Vegas adventure."
316,"This is consistently a great restaurant to go to on The Strip: the service is great and the food is fantastic.The typical thing to order are the Steak and Frites, which are always a great option.  There are plenty of great steak options and all are great quality beef.  Even the bread that arrives with dinner is fresh and steaming and perfect when you add the butter to it...the bread also arrives with a brined/pickled carrot slaw/salad that is surprisingly good - tangy with a bit of spice and perfect with buttered bread.  The wine list is great and one can find something that suits their palate - I had a Pinot Nior that was delicate, but stood up to the strong flavor of the beef.  The desserts are also really good - profiteroles, chocolate cake, bread pudding."
317,"Breakfast:  They are open for breakfast 7-11.  We had a great breakfast outside.  Quick seating, good service, lovely food.  I especially like the crusty bread for toast.  The menu has lots of choices, and at bargain prices I thought.  We stayed for an extra bloody mary and the morning air."
318,"Outside dining makes this good restaurant five stars to me -- especially on a night where it cools off and you can watch the light shows of the Bellagio.   Don't count on the cooling down so much in summer!  There are many giant umbrellas to keep you out of the sun's direct wrath.  The sandwiches of the day are just a full-mouth electric taste jamboree.  We had a roast beef open face sandwich with brie and crisp, juicy and tart cherry tomatoes, and some France-themed Sangria.  The $20 carafe is four highball glasses and a must if you and your friends are parched.  The Steak Frites are delightful too, and plentiful.  If you can finish a side-basket of them, you should try out for eating contests.  Great location and food!"
319,"My wife and I's favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, it never lets us down.We were immediately seated in the bar/patio (inside) with an incredible view of the Strip and the Bellagio's fountains. Our server was Herve who was very French and very good. Our starter's were the French Onion Soup which was bursting with cheese and flavor and the Mussels Marinière. It was our first time with the mussels and they were just incredible. We will definitely get them again. I followed it up with the Steak Bearnaise which is a very thin New York I believe served with Bearnaise on the side and the best frites, my wife had the signature steak which is an 8oz filet topped with merlot butter and the same frites."
320,"Best place for casual romantic outdoor dining in Vegas. Mon Ami Gabi is located in the Paris Hotel, directly across from the water show at the Bellagio.  They don't take reservations, so please plan to arrive early and put your name on the list.  Wait time is usually an hour.  Ask to be seated outside, especially if this is your first time in Vegas and the weather permits. 3 stars for food4 stars for the viewThis is a really great way to enjoy the view of the strip.  Smile.  You're in VEGAS!"
321,"What to say about this establishment, but exsquisite. The staff was friendly, and for the high demand of the outdoor dining area, the wait wasn't unreasonable. The food? Every dish we sampled was a new and different taste. Great salads, lovely smoked salmon, even the escargot, it being my first time, was well prepared with it's own distinct flavor. This place deserves 5 stars, outright, but for *one* huge factor. It doesn't have a bathroom. Period. You physically have to leave the restaurant if you want to/have to use the facilities, and that detracts from the ambience that they work so hard to create. Other than that? Absolutely worth it."
322,"The place:Located in the Paris Casino & Hotel facing the strip, this sidewalk cafe was busy, but not overwhelming.  Our server was a bit frazzled, but was apologetic and once he was on task, it was great service.The food:My wife ordered the breakfast crepe - wow. Carmelized sugar, thinly stacked delicate crepes, and a boat of fresh whipped cream.  I ordered a breakfast omelet which was delicious, but standard for an omelet.  The highlight of my meal was the bread and preserves.  The coffee was fine and plentiful all in all a great meal.Bottom line:If you're in Las Vegas and tired of buffets give these guys a try."
323,"Sign this was going to be my first and only trip to Mon Ami: Having made reservations far in advance for our party of 8, the hostess refused to seat us because one single member of our party was missing in the restroom. So, rather than sit and begin to order appetizers, we were relegated to the ""time out"" corner until our bladder-busting buddy could join us. Sure, it was crowded, but not packed, and it appeared that we were one of the few groups who either a) made reservations or b) dressed as if we were going to a nice dinner and not an auto auction.Each of my friends ordered versions of the filet, some with a peppercorn sauce and others without. I went different with a hamburger (having eaten prior and also intrigued at what France would do to one of my favorite American inventions). I asked the burger be cooked ""medium"" and what I got was a blood-red mess that needed to be sent back. The meals are all served with traditional steak fries, which to me tasted like fried bits of batter and were too much like broken potato chips to eat with your fingers or a fork. Either way, it was a pretty unsatisfying meal for the $13 bucks it cost. I can't speak for the rest of the group who thoroughly enjoyed their meals. However, they had been drinking various mixed drinks for hours previous so they could have eaten fried roadkill cooked in a used gym sock and would have probably savored it with no complaints.The only positive about the place was Frangria (which I imagine implies France's take on the traditional Spanish concoction). I now believe that it was called such based on the fact that it was Franzia boxed wine and fruit. either way, it was served in a large, chilled pitcher with delicious fruit and packed a pretty mean buzz between two adults. Definitely worth a try with dinner."
324,"I love their steaks. They are quite yummy. I've also had the prime rib here, it is tasty. Very succulent, moist, and tender. I have also had the crepe during lunch. Great choice. It wasn't too filling and not too light either. One time we came here for a bachelorette party/dinner and we had to wait a little longer than our reserved time. The manager felt so bad he gave us 6-8 free appetizers on the house. We ordered all the seafood appetizers. And he was right! Not a cent charged for them! And, they were all quite delicious.Not a huge fan of the fries... but I'll live by eating other things there :)"
325,"I really enjoyed this restaurant prior to my last visit.  The quality of food was lower than previous visits.  My husband's onion soup had an unappetizing proportion of cheese to soup. It was pretty much a big bowl of cheese.  I ordered the scallops which were overly salted and I tend to like my food a little more salty than others. We sat outside overlooking the fountain at the Bellagio which was awesome.  This place has a great view of the strip. While eating, my husband and I noticed an employee (we assumed a manager) who kept running around talking into a mouthpiece loudly about which stage of dining everyone was on. For example, ""Just cleared apps."" or ""Currently on main dishes"".  We both found this a little annoying. We waited for a table for over an hour and didn't want to feel rushed when it was our turn to eat."
326,"Excellent breakfast spot!We had:*Ham & Cheese Omelette - Eggs and hash browns were cooked perfect!*Steak Frites - Any time I can have this for breakfast I'm ordering it.  Can't believe I passed this place up our first morning, but even glad that we came back to it the next morning."
327,"I'll admit that the lovely patio, overlooking the Strip and Bellagio fountains, might justify picking this restaurant. However, if you're not going here for the atmosphere, don't go here at all. The food and service are just mediocre. The free baguettes are the best part -  the French onion soup and the two apps I tried (escargot and chips with blue cheese dip) were just okay. This is French bistro fare commercialized (those from the Chicago area will know that this is a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant, all of which I have found to be underwhelming). Service wasn't their strong suit either. When we walked in, around 6PM on a Monday evening, and told them we just wanted some drinks and apps, the hostess said she couldn't seat us for that. After looking around at the 75% empty dining room and probably looking at her strangely, she called her manager to get the OK to seat us. As someone who's worked as a restaurant server, I can tell you that any place should be thrilled to have a table like that - high tab from alcohol and quick turnover. Then our server seemed a bit out of it. So if you're just looking for a reasonably priced place overlooking the Bellagio fountains, Mon Ami will fit the bill, but if you care equally about the food and service, you'll be a bit disappointed."
328,"Maybe I am losing my mind, but I thought the breakfast menu here used to be a little more French. The breakfast offerings were hard to distinguish from an average slightly fussy brunch place in the Bay Area. Example: the French toast was called ""french toast"" and not ""pain perdu"", and there was nothing on the menu that reminded me of eating in Paris.My omlette was just fine, though more American than French in style (big and fluffy), but my better half's crepes were so bad that she had to send them back. The server acknowledged that she did not like that dish, nor do many of their guests. I saw another guest's crepe go nearly uneaten as well. The coffee was so-so.Service was a little slow at times, but server was happy to substitute another dish for said crepes. The atmosphere (al fresco on the strip) has always been the draw here, but the breakfast was unremarkable."
329,"Came here for Christmas dinner finally after numerous trips to vegas and saying ""I want to go there!!""  Well I finally went and it was great food.  We ordered the cheese plate for appetizer and it was to die for, especially with the fresh baked baguette that they kept brining to my table after we fell in love with it.   We ordered the 22 oz bone in steak to share with garlic spinach and whipped cauliflower.  OMG!!! it was better than mashed potatoes and was just the best fluffy, creamy goodness that I have ever tasted.  The steak was cooked to perfection and the ambience was the best as well.  I am a sucker for parisian ambience and this place is the place for it.  I must say I was a little ticked off by the staff that help the waiters at the table... they were not the nicest people and just plopped and slided the plates on the table when they arrived, until I had to say something and they they all got nice....... interesting. Needless to say our waitress was fantastic and answered all our questions about the menu and made sure to check on us without being too overbearing.  Apparently the hot ticket dinner item was the beef bourginione which I will have to order next time I am in vegas..... love that beef!!!"
330,"I came here for lunch with my family.  I must say I really enjoyed this place.  I didn't expect to wait for seating midday Saturday, but there was about a 20 minute wait.  We ended up getting a table on the outside patio with a straightshot view to the Bellagio water fountain.  There were trees in our view, but we still got to experience 3 or 4 water shows.  Beyond the location and environment, the food was quite good.  The first thing to note is the bread.  Fresh baguettes from the oven, properly made and served with a crisp crust and soft inside (baguettes aren't supposed to be rock hard).  We started with a dozen oysters (blue points, i think).  My parents have never had ""real"" raw oysters, having most of their experiences from AYCE asian buffets.  They were very impressed at the freshness and quality of these oysters.  Objectively, they were very fresh and tasty.  I couldn't figure out how a restaurant in the middle of the desert could have such a ready supply of fresh oysters, but nothing about the flavor or odor suggested that they weren't top notch quality.  For our main dish, our table had the chicken crepe, seafood crepe, roast beef sandwich, and the halibut.  Just about everything was good, but I especially liked the seafood crepe.  Large sea scallops adorned on a shrimp and fish crepe.All in all, it wasn't super pricey, the food was great, and the environment was fun and refreshing.  I would definitely return."
331,"Extremely attentive wait staff made sure that all of our needs were taken care of. The food was terrific. The steak is much thinner than expected because (as it was explained to me) that is the way French steaks are prepared. Regardless, it was great. The side items were also extremely good: the Garlic Spinach is a must have."
332,"I've never dined in Paris before, but from what I would picture, this would be pretty close. Mon Ami Gabi is such a cute French restaurant, and if you can get patio seating, it's pretty cool outside! I went for brunch with my family, so I'm not sure what dinner is like (hence 4 stars), but their service was excellent and the food was terrific.We actually got patio seating at first, but then the day was so windy that we asked to be seated inside again. They still gave us a seat right next to the window, so the view was almost the exact same. =) We ordered a cream of oyster soup with a hint of saffron and something else. It was really cute how they brought it out. The waitress carried out a huge shallow bowl and a kettle and poured the soup into the bowl from the kettle! What a unique way of keeping soup warm...at least that's the first time I've seen it like that! She also brought out 4 spoons for us to share the soup. And it's sharable, believe me. It was really yummy too, and I'm not an oyster fan. But the color of the soup was almost like it wasn't cream, but butternut squash puree or something. The consistency wasn't as chunky though, but it was light and filling. Their French bread with the soup was a good pairing as well.My mom got the chicken, spinach, and brie crepe and that thing was enormous! It was good too, but maybe could have been more savory. Perhaps because brie isn't very salty as a cheese. My dad got the quiche lorraine, which the server recommended over the leek and butternut squash quiche, and I'm glad she did because it really was good. It wasn't too dense, but of course I'm sure if my dad didn't share, it would have been overwhelming. And it wasn't just a slice either; it was an entire mini-quiche. I think this was my favorite. The cream + cheese and bacon and onions were amazing!My sister got a chicken BLT sandwich and it came with these waffle fries, which my mom and dad loved. I wasn't such a big fan because they were a little too oily for my liking, but they had a good crisp to them . Her sandwich was really good though! And it was actually really filling too. I ordered a salmon...something with salad. haha And it was good, but I mean, how hard is it to mess up on salmon? The salad had a good dressing to it and it wasn't too overpowering.Overall, it was a delightful and refreshing brunch with very nice servers! It also wasn't terribly overpriced. I think our total bill came to be a little less than $85. =)"
333,"Looks upscale. We went for lunch. Short menu, but I will confirm that the reviews concerning the steak were accurate. I had the steak sandwich and it was great! The steak was done medium well and it was tender. We were seated inside but in the back where there were windows so it was not dark. In fact our area was not only completely lit it looked fantastic. The waiters were also quite polite."
334,"Great food at ""reasonable"" prices for Vegas all while allowing you to watch the Bellagio fountain show. This was the best meal I had in Vegas last time including a couple at Wynn and Bellagio. The food alone is worth the trip, but when you add the fact that you can get that sidewalk french cafe feel overlooking the Bellagio water and that its priced at about half of many comparable meals, it all ads up to this being my favorite spot in Vegas. Go, you won't regret it!"
335,"Was just there for Saturday lunch in December 2009. Started with a fresh hot baguette for the table..which was delicious. Crunchy and soft in all the right places. I got the Croque Monsieur ..that was divine! Ham and cheese and a fried egg.. on great bread. So so good!! My friend got the special of the day, which was a duck and fig open faced sandwich, which was spectacular as well. Someone else at the table got the steak sandwich..which was plain compared to our two dishes. It wasn't bad, it was just bland and boring. He ended up eating some of my sammy. My other friend had the Eggs & Beef Bourguignon and said it was mediocre at best.. Becareful of the mimosas. We got a couple..and when the bill came it was $10 a pop!! So not worth it, since you can get unlimted mimosas at all the brunch buffets for like $5. And they tasted the same."
336,"Oh, Mon Ami Gabi. So yummy. This place also holds a special place in my heart for two reasons: 1) it was when I started becoming a foodie and appreciating what I ate (I'll blame it on the escargots), and 2) the first time I went to Vegas with my best friend and now-husband, we ate here and it was amazing.Two of us arrived for a reservation for four (the other two were parking the car). Even after being told that, we were led to a corner table with only one extra chair. The guy who took us over was in a suit, so I'm assuming he was one of the managers and not a regular server. He looked more than slightly annoyed and aloof when I reminded him that we were a party of four.Despite the spotty welcome, our server was attentive and we had a wonderful time (even saw some behind-the-scenes raging in the kitchen behind us, haha), We started off with their warm bread, French onion soup, lobster bisque, sea scallops, and escargots. Everything was delicious as expected, especially the French onion soup and the massive amount of cheese. MMM!For entrees, I had the seared salmon. It had this lemon cream on it that was soooo good. It was cooked perfectly too; it melted in my mouth. I had a bite of my husband's grilled cheese with short ribs and kinda wished I had room for that as well, haha.Our friends got a sandwich special and the trout, but I didn't have a bite so I can't comment.Dessert was the profiteroles. We all said ""Oh we'll just have a small bite"" when we ordered, but we absolutely DEVOURED the thing when it came out.Yes, it was a lot of food, but hey, it was New Year's day and we were living it up. ;)"
337,"On a chilly night got a table on the patio. Heat lamps kept it comfortable. Had a nice view of the Bellagio fountains. Told the waiter of my wife's gluten allergy and he said ""don't worry, we'll take care of it"".  They swapped out the walnut date bread on the cheese board with some rice flour crisps that were excellent. I had the oyster cream soup, superb. We both had salmon, mine in a spinach salad and hers on a bed of Yukon gold potatoes and onions. Both were awesome. We shared a very good bottle of Rosé and the bill came to only $108. Service was attentive yet inconspicuous. Considering the setting, quality, service and price, I have to give this 5 stars, it's a fantastic option for a romantic meal in Vegas at a reasonable price."
338,"The food and waiter service is great. Meals arrived quickly after ordering. Everything from the starting bread to the desert was delicious. I recommend the Warm Chocolate Bread Pudding. The only downside is that it can get a bit noisy, and you can be left waiting 30mins to be seated if you happen to miss your reservation-time by 15mins. But all and all a very pleasant experience. I'll be back again."
339,"Great solid spot in the heart of the Vegas strip, loud and fast atmosphere without losing a nice bit of charm. Dimly lit inside with candles on the tables this is a great spot to get a steak and frites or any other bistro style meal. It's not a super high line restaurant but is a solid choice for a good diner where you leave feeling like you had a great meal. Not a gimmicky laced place, it's straight forward and nicely put together, a no nonsense place."
340,My food came wrong! Then they didn't even offer to substitute until the rest of the table had finished eating. I asked then to describe a beer and they brought it without telling me it was NON ALCOHOLIC. They didn't offer to take it back. Won't be returning on subsequent trips to vegas!
341,"My husband and I were so glad that we picked Mon Ami Gabi in the many choices of Vegas restaurants. We both think that was one of the best dinner in Vegas so far for us. We made a reservation originally. But when we got there, there was no line for patio seating. Because I have read so much about the patio seating, we decided to sit on the patio. It was incredible. Although there were trees between Paris hotel and Bellagio, you can still see the water show pretty well. Every 15 mins, you can listen to the music and enjoy the show without standing. The best part was the food. The bread was great, and it tasted very good with the carrot topping. We had the FRENCH ONION SOUP first. Unlike other french onion soup, this broth was very light. There was so much cheese, and the cheese was good. For main course, I had SEARED SALMON. The salmon was perfectly cooked and moist. The lemon creme fraiche was excellent! There can't be a better match. I wish I know how to make this dish! My husband ordered FILET MIGNON WITH BLUE CHEESE SAUCE. He put those two things together. It wasn't on the menu. When I had the first bite of the beef, the strong favor of the blue cheese hit me right away. Then, I can taste the beef. The beef was so tender. It can almost melt in my mouth. The frites were delicious too. The more you eat them, the more you like them! We couldn't pass on the dessert. We had CREME BRULEE. That was the BEST creme brulee that I had in my life. Creamy and sweet! The meal was wonderful! The service was great! And, the view was amazing! The price wasn't too scary either. It was about $80 for the two of us. I know that I will be coming back to this restaurant, when I am back in Vegas next time."
342,"This was my third time on the patio at this classic restaurant. I brought 3 ladies with me that had never been before. I think they loved it. One was on a budget and was able to enjoy for aprox $20.00. The rest of us went a little crazy. Blue cheese stuffed olives in my martini is always the best way to get me started. We tried the scallop appetizer which was done rockerfeller style, they were flavorful & decadent. I tried the lamb chop special with thier perfect frites. The lamb was overly salty but otherwise yummy. It was served with average ratatouille. We tried the bananas foster (nice) and the chocolate mousse for dessert (lovely) I can't wait to go back!"
343,"How can you not love this place??!! This is in my top three restaurants in Las Vegas. We have eaten here maybe 5 or 6 times and each time has been wonderful. Some of the best service we've had. Last time or server was a older gentleman with a heavy French accent. Very friendly and accommodating to some things that we ordered that were not on the menu. We've had steaks, white fish (light breading), salmon, crepes, salads, and this last time an omelet. All of it has been great. I'm not a big ""Frites"" fan and so I usually substitute mashed potatoes. I learned this last time that the potatoes are so good because of all the cream and butter that goes into it. Good for you....No. Great tasting....absolutely! The atmosphere is fantastic with the Bellagio fountain show directly across the street. At night you can see the shows every 15 minutes. The restaurant itself is very classy looking and romantic. It has the look - and location- of an expensive place but the prices are surprisingly moderate - steaks in the low 20's, fish in the high teens and lunch crepes with a salad for about $12.Oh, and not to be gross, be sure to check out the restrooms just behind the restaurant.  They have a recording playing of pick up lines and things you'll hear at the Paris.  It's English, then translated into French.  It is quit funny and amusing.  I learned how to say: ""If you were a sandwich, you'd be a Mc-Babe with Cheese."" and ""Your father must have been a baker, 'cause you've got nice buns"".  So, if I ever go to France, I'll have some French under my belt.   Hey!! That sounds like a pick up line right there!!"
344,"Mon Ami is a wonderful bistro -- great service & a lovely menu.We were there around lunch time -- so we went with a chicken liver pate mousse with the three cheese plate. Definitely enough for two for lunch. Absolutely delicious & the baguette, butter and an excellent by the glass wine selection definitely hit the spot.  The mousse was topped with a divine mustard & merlot reduction -- didn't look real appealing, but the flavor was spot on.  Our cheese plate included a roquefort, brie & a mild cheddar like cheese, in addition to the dried currants, raisins, nuts, sliced apples, etc.  Perfect!We sat inside, so no view of the Bellagio fountains or the people on the sidewalk, yet we enjoyed the comfy & club feel to the bistro furnishings.  Our waiter was great -- confirmed & redirected (as necessary our wine selection).  We are not knowledgable of French wines vis a vis US wines, so his input was definitely useful.Lunch was $65, with 3 glasses of wine.  A great deal -- for a great lunch.We had intended to make breakfast, but overslept -- we will definitely make it there either for breakfast or dinner -- both menus looked great!"
345,"There are a handful of stalwarts on the Strip, a constant stream of new offerings, and several mediocrities that survive by inertia. Few moderate venues put in the effort to maintain themselves. Mon Ami Gabi is different. After about ten years in the same location, the room looks as new (or new-old) as the day it opened. Really! The tile floors are spotless! The paint is fresh. The waitstaff are far from complacent. And the food is delivered hot and correct, starting with the complimentary warm baguette and carrot relish. Modeled after an idealized Parisian bistro--but thankfully not overburdened by the cliché Lautrec prints--MAG is deceptively big (nearly 400 seats) but divided into several different sections--depending on your mood, you can sit in a dark, book-lined bar room, a warmly lit interior, a comfortable but energetic pavilion, or a boisterous Strip-side patio. The menu follows traditional French brasserie food, but goes the extra mile in terms of variety. Thus the menu includes a vegetarian sampler, fish choices including Skate, a good looking short rib, and over 10 different steak frites varieties. My Steak Bordelaise was, well, perfect. Their ribbon-style fries didn't impress though--true French frites, in my experience, are actually very close to McDonald's, believe it or not. The chicken liver pate was a healthy portion. Prices are not shockingly low, but for the Strip, strike a relative value. There's no reason you can't have that romantic dinner here for 100 dollars, instead of spending 300 somewhere else. Consistency is a quality to be praised in any restaurant--in one wth a prime Strip position that could easily coast on its vantage point, it's almost a wonder."
346,"good but not outstanding food, sick views of the fountain, and a little too dim for family outing."
347,"Good selection of wine, I had their Fillet Mignon, several bottles of wine, and a nice Sorbet desert.Their food is very tasty (Too many fries, would love to see other side dishes ""included""), and it is right across from the Bellagio so you can see the water shows from your table.Overall, it was a great experience, the lighting is very dark and moody so great for intimate dinners, and the fountain show always adds something to the experience."
348,"It's a decent, casual place on Vegas strip to chill, have some great food, and to get away from the blistering heat outside for a bit.The service is great. I asked for seats that is close as possible to patio but not actually out in the sun and they got us a perfect table. We ordered escargot baked in herb butter, scallops baked in more butter (this was really yummy), steak au poivre, and a entree salad to share between two. Everything was delicious and in good portion size."
349,"Huge place. We dined on the heated patio overlooking the Bellagio fountains. Dinner and a show.Number 19 was our server. Evidently, the original location chooses not to advertise the server's names. She (Sharon) was quietly efficient without being too cool for the room. Amazing selection of French wines, escargot (piping hot and tasty), and oysters (super fresh with a watermelon finish).The black cod was pure perfection, but they are best known for their filet mignon. Perfect medium rare, super buttery meat. The ribeye was 22 ounces of marbled salty bliss. Phenomenal. Terrific."
350,"Stopped here for breakfast while out in Vegas for CES / AVN shows. It was a bit chilly so we dined inside but overlooking the strip.   The waitress was super-friendly.   We ordered some drinks... apple juice, orange juice and some coffee.   The apple juice tasted like it was just made...so fresh!   My friend and I both ordered the breakfast specials.   I had Eggs Benedict with Salmon and my friend had a lemon, carmel, cherry crepe  (something like that...can't remember what it was called) with homemade whipped cream.   The portions were huge and the food was delicious!!!     Definitely one of the best breakfasts that we have had. Would highly recommend!   (though not cheap....total bill was $52...)"
351,I've probably been to a better place. But I can't remember when.  Absolute best quality value and location in Vegas
352,"I had no background information on this restaurant, and low expectations for a place located so near the front door of a casino.I was expecting high prices and mediocre food. So we ventured further into the casino, looking at restaurants and menus, all the way to Bally's. That's when we realized that the restaurant we were meant to go to was way back at the first place we looked, Mon Ami Gabi.I love hanger steak, and it was on the menu for a mere $20. We went on a Friday night, no reservations, and were seated immediately with a choice of the patio or inside. We opted for inside, and were given seats right at the patio window. Best of both worlds, it turned out, because we had all the views of the patio and Bellagio fountains, and all the warmth of the interior.We are not gut-buster buffet eaters.  In fact, listening to some frantic gamblers that evening talk about how they stuffed themselves silly on a comped buffet turned us right off of trough feeding. So we ordered the hanger steak, medium rare, and a frisee salad with bacon and soft poached egg, and a glass of wine.Loved the sauce, coupled with the thin, crisp fries that came with the steak. And I adored all that warm yummy yolk oozing into my salad dressing. Fresh, hot, crusty baguette and a pot of soft butter came to the table, along with a few mouthfuls of fine carrot salad.  We didn't need more bread, but it was so good we got a second baguette and used it to soak up the sauces of our two dishes.On short trips, I rarely frequent one place multiple times, but felt that a breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi would be good. It was good, and we sat outside this time in the sunshine, just as the Bellagio waters were springing into action.This time, unfortunately, we were in a hurry, so the experience wasn't as enjoyable. But even with more time to linger, we still would have preferred dinner there over breakfast. Of particular note in the breakfast was the bacon. Thick, streaky, but not overly fatty, flat. Like it had been roasted rather than fried. Yum.Why 4 stars, rather than 5? I love hanger steak. I love hanger steak even more when that one strand of fiber is quietly cut from the length of the steak before it's cooked and becomes virtually impossible to remove without mincing the whole piece up.  Floss is one item the TSA will still let me take on a plane, I'd don't need it in my steak. Two quick slashes and it's gone, it's so easy and will vastly improve anyone's enjoyment of the dish.Given the opportunity, I'd definitely come back for dinner. For what it's worth, Ibrahim was my dinner server, and Brenda was my breakfast. Thanks!"
353,"Looking at other reviews of this restaurant, I can find nothing to disagree with. Mon Ami Gabi is a great dining experience. It is in a great location right off the sidewalk which makes for great people watching. Plus having the added benefit of seeing the fountain show at the Bellagio right across the street without having to leave your seat - perfect. The food and service is top notch as well. We started with Washington state Penn Cove oysters which were briny and delicious. Main course: I selected a perfectly cooked New York strip with shallots and burgundy sauce; the galpal ordered the Steak Classique with maítre d'hôtel butter - a butter sauce thick with garlic, parsley and shallots. Out of this world! The faux Parisian décor is not too overwhelming or distracting - they manage to pull it off. An added bonus is this was one of the more reasonably priced meals of our trip. Since my wallet was hemorrhaging in the casino, this was a nice surprise."
354,"My husband and I first came upon Mon Ami Gabi on a trip to Vegas back in 2000. We had just gone up the Eiffel Tower and when we came down we were hungry. It was pretty late so rather than wander the strip aimlessly looking for something to eat, we decided to head into Mon Ami Gabi and give it a try. We were so glad we did because it was one of the best meals we had on that trip. Every year we go to Vegas, every time we're there we eat at Mon Ami Gabi at least once. The steaks are perfect, the service is good and the atmosphere is wonderful. I only remember one time where one of the people in our party didn't care for their steak, they didn't realize that a hangar steak is a very tough cut. The server took note that the steak was hardly touched and when they found out they reason why they promptly removed the steak, asked what else we would like and made the substitution. The steak was comped and the subtituted item was not added to the bill. That's service! I also love Mon Ami Gabi's cocktails, in particular their Espresso Martini, so good!  All in all this is a great place that we go to again and again, wouldn't be a trip to Vegas without a stop at Mon Ami Gabi. I think we'll try the breakfast next time we go."
355,"Is no one else disturbed by the fact that the servers have name tags with numbers on them and not names? We were served by #64. Topped off by the fact that the bread came in a bag with the restaurant's cheesy logo stamped on it and when I went to wipe my bread crumbs off the table, noticed that the linen tablecloths were covered in butcher paper, this restaurant did not live up to the expectation presented by the concierge that referred us to it. I think if we had gone in with the expectation that this restaurant was run of the mill, it would have been okay. It just would have been nice if the prices matched the quality of the meal."
356,"Fantastic food! Great service. We had the warm brie with roasted garlic (the garlic was roasted in someting that made it sweet and a bit crunchy). This was soooo good. Next we had the roast beef sandwich w/fries (almost like thin sliced french fries) and salad with salmon. Both excellent. Dessert - creme brulee. Very good, but not the best I've had. Service was exceptional. Would like to try other menu items. Would definitely go back!"
357,"The service wasn't great, but the food, my god..... was.I had the Filet with Merlot butter and I have been dreaming of it ever since. The wine selection is extensive and for that- I like as well. The pricing was decent for the quality and amount. I will for sure be back!Tip: if you pass up the Mashed Cauliflower... there is seriously something wrong with you. It was heaven on a plate. Mmmmm..."
358,"Ate here with a group, and it was good, but not to the five-star level.  I started sharing the escargot, which was a first for me.  They tasted like mushrooms, which I guess is was most people say.  Chalk one up for the adventure but I'm not sure if I'd get them again.  Next, I had the oysters, which were good except for the horseradish, which was too chunky.  The caesar salad had a little too much dressing but it was still a little bland.  For dinner, I had the filet with merlot butter, which apparently was the same filet I had last time that I didn't especially like (but it still obviously looks good on the menu because I still got it).  It was cooked well, and the merlot butter gives it a different taste... not necessarily bad, but not what I was expecting (which is why I didn't like it the first time).  I didn't eat any of my fries and I would have much rather had something else.  For dessert, I tried the bananas foster crepe, which was delicious!  Overall, an alternative to a fancy steakhouse, but beware of the unique steaks.   The fries were excessive (yes, I know, that's why people like this place), but the desserts were good."
359,"If you're looking for mouth watering steak, look no further than Mon Ami Gabi. They start you out with a complementary loaf of French bread and delicious butter. We ordered the lobster bisque which was an acquired taste I thought, and I ended up liking the soup a lot. For my entree, I had the filet mignon cooked medium which melted right in my mouth. The filet had some kind of butter merlot sauce that was simply amazing. The fries were a delicious addition to balance out the taste. My boyfriend had the New York Strip steak which had some kind of red wine reduction and peppercorn which complimented the steak very well. His steak was also very tender an juicy. The server was great and made very good suggestions when asked. He recommeneded a white wine called Vouvray, which had a sweet taste to it. Although I read that it's great with seafood, I felt it paired well with steak also. Basically, the food is amazing. Some of the best steak I've had in a while. This is my second time going and they have been very consistent. The portions are a good size for individual servings and the prices are well worth it and affordable for the food and experience.  I recommend outside patio seating because you get an added view of the Bellagio fountains. Hint hint for a perfect date setting or even a night out with friends."
360,"Loved sitting outside in the patio overlooking the Bellagio water fountain and the music that goes along with it.  It's also a great place to people-watch, just like you would in Paris!Even though my party went to eat a late lunch at 3pm, the place was still packed.  So prep yourself for a short wait, just in case you are extremely hungry and need food in your stomach right away.Dishes I loved:- Baguettes that they give you for free!  So yummy.  My friends who spent some time in Paris said they taste just as good.- Mussels Mariniere had really good white sauce that goes well with the baguettes- French onion soup was pretty decent too.Dishes that my friends loved, but that I thought was okay:- Steak SandwichThey also have such an extensive menu that I will for sure come back to try other dishes.If you are in town and feel like some french food but don't want to pay the Bouchon price, check out Mon Ami Gabi!"
361,"I liked this place a lot.  We wanted a late lunch/early dinner before our 7:00 show, so we arrived around 4:15 and asked for a seat at one of the tables on the balcony looking across the street at the Bellagio and it's water & light show.  It was a great place to people- and fountain-watch as the sun faded from the sky.I had mussels with frites and my husband had the NY Strip steak.  We were both every happy with our meals.  The mussels were in a spicy broth with onions, garlic and possibly coconut milk.  The frites were hot and crisp and plentiful.  The hot crisp baguette was one of the best I've had in a long long time.  Mmmm.Struck up a conversation with a pair of friendly locals at the next table who were celebrating their anniversary.  Service was very good, even though we were there at a shift change."
362,"The location inside the Paris restaurant is a great Strip location.  The patio is where to be.  You can see a great view of the Bellagio fountains, however some of the trees across Las Vegas Blvd. hinder the the view of the water show.  It's a great place to dine to people watch or to just get down on the food.  I ordered a fish dish the sole (off the valentines day menu), and my friend ordered the signature filet w/merlot butter sauce which came with frites (more like soft potato-ish chips).  The steak was amazing.  very juicy and tender and the sauce was to die for.  For an appetizer we had the scallops which were my favorite and also had the jumpo shrimp which was so-so.  Wines were good and service was great!  I would def go back and dine there again.  The prices aren't too bad, dinner entrees from $17-31."
363,"Don't let the fact that this place is inside the Paris Casino fool you.My Friend Gabi, you were so delish.  Paris Casino has dropped from its prime, if it ever was on same level as the other major properties so you wouldn't expect the food at this place to be at such a high level.Since the wait was crazy long for outdoor seating, I opted for sitting inside which was fine because it reminded me of the autumn brunches and afternoons I had in Paris, very traditional decor inside with dark rich colors.  The tables here just like in Paris are crammed together.  The service was great, I had the plate du jour, which was a Meatloaf Sandwich, this is a classic French Bistro so the bread they give you was incredible enough, and the bread for the sandwich did not disappoint either.  The meat in the sandwich was yummy, but it was rather petite, the fries that accompanied the sandwich was a disappoint though.  They were crispy but too thin for me, and this is a French bistro so why are you offering me ketchup?  I had to ask for mayo, and out comes this big-ass gravy boat of mayo, they didn't have any small sauces cups or something.  Besides the size the mayo tasted like homemade, French people love mayo to the point that they will make their own, and this is not home-made.Oh I had a drink which was okay too, really decent price, good joint, MAKE RESERVATIONS (online or phone), sit outside unless it is sweltering and enjoy."
364,this place is a gem in vegas especially for lunch time dining.  we got the steak frites and also the seafood crepe .  most things are a rip-off in vegas but i thought this establishment was very fair and well-done.
365,I came here with a group of friends because I have always heard good things about this place.  Our server was friendly and really attentive which was a plus.Other than that everyone's food was average and I had a salad with grilled chicken added.  My chicken tasted like tuna.  Enough said.
366,"Definitely a Must-Eat Brunch location in Las Vegas.Gosh, I love the fact that Mon Ami Gabi overlooks the Bellagio Fountains and has outdoor season that is really neat.The wait times sucked, but oh well. We ordered the hanger steak (good) with thinly cut fries and the seared salmon. Really good food overall, wasn't blown away by the steak, but wasn't disappointed.We LOVED the French Onion Soup. So cheesey and good. Also, loved the desserts of Banana Foster Crepes with Vanilla Ice Cream. Gosh, you can say that again. Loved the dessert of Banana Foster Crepes with Vanilla Ice Cream! Will come back! If I don't lose too much money!"
367,"Mon Ami Gabi is a slightly lit restaurant in which I almost tripped (jk). I came here for a friend's birthday dinner. I ordered the Steak Classic - medium rare - it came with really thin cut fries and the steak was topped with a pesto butter sauce. My only qualm is that the piece wasn't as tender as I had hoped for MR. For appetizers, we ordered escargot, mussles, and crab cakes. The crab cake was a little dry but the other two were fantastic.There are so many other restaurants in Vegas I want to try so I probably won't be back for while. I'd recommend you give this spot a shot if you're in the area (Paris Hotel)."
368,"Mon Ami Gabi mimics a Parisian cafe perfectly. I loved the decor and we sat in an atrium overlooking the Bellagio water show, which was lovely. I had a very tasty cheeseburger (with gruyere cheese, moan) with thin cut french fries. My friends all loved their meals as well, and one of them said if he had known the Scallops appetizer was so delicious, he would have gotten 4 of them. Our server was friendly and attentive...it took a while to get our check, but we all chalked it up to being Parisian style. One very cool thing is they have carts of wine that you can get by the glass. Makes it very easy if only one person wants wine. I would definitely go here again and this time I would wear my beret. :)"
369,"Really like this place. Came here about a year ago with my boyfriend at the time. It was considered an anniversary situation so we had reservations to sit outside in the patio area, overlooking the Bellagio and the fountain. Definitely a great location. If you sit for long enough, you might be able to catch quite a few fountain shows, which I always love =)As for food, it was very delicious. We got the escargot to start off, which was amazing. Entree wise, I got a fish and he got a steak. I don't remember exactly what we ordered but both were amazing. Drinks were okay too, and dessert was good. I wish I yelped about this earlier so I would remember exactly what I ate, but this just means that I will have to come back again! The food was definitely very good, and I would come back anytime.In addition, the service was really good too. Even though the restaurant was pretty packed on a Friday night, the waiter didn't kick us out or pressure us to leave, even though we ended up sitting for nearly 3hrs. Definitely worth going!!"
370,"I really wanted to like this place. a lot. I really did. I guess my experience had a bit of lackluster, but I wasn't thoroughly pleased with my visit here.  I went with my gf over valentine's day weekend for lunch during on valentine's day.  We made reservations over open table a week before and we were seated inside the outer facing windows of the restaurant.  The atmosphere of the place is really beautiful, it really has you feeling like you're somewhere french other than sitting in a restaurant in vegas. She got the caesar salad while I got the cheese and onion soup (my apologies, I don't remember the actual name of it), and while the salad wasn't as tasty as others I've had, the soup was something to try if you've never had it.She had ordered mussels for her main dish while I ordered the macaroni and cheese.  I should've ordered something else but I didn't know what else to order; I didn't like my dish at all. =TMy gf keeps raving about the place a lot, though she prefers that we go in the evening than during lunch (she says the menu is completely different at night).  I'll give this place another chance, but I surely won't get that macaroni dish ever again."
371,"This was a fun spot for a meal with a couple of colleagues when we were out in Las Vegas. we had reservations and were seated right as we arrived. It was a cool evening, so I was thankful that we had a table indoors, but it looked like the patio had lovely views of the Bellagio fountain {it was heated}. We all started with a glass of wine or a cocktail & I opted for some sort of peach martini... It was delish, albeit a bit stout :-) Next, the bread - not nearly as tasty as the French loaf at Bouchon, but fine - pretty standard. A number of us ordered the Steak Frite, although two of us opted for filets, over the flat steak that comes with the dish. They're are a number of amazing-sounding topping options... anything from a shallot butter to a holaindase sauce and blu cheese topping, but I went for the Dijon sauce = a sure winner!One thing I wasn't totally crazy about were the frites. The first few were yummy, but overall they were more like thick potato chips, as opposed to French fried potatoes... I think my tastebuds were wishing for something softer, fluffier; if we went back, I'd sub the frites for the whipped potatoes, always a favorite of mine! A few of our dining partners ordered the fish of the day & simply raved about it! I think we all left after a fun, rich meal very full & happy :-)"
372,"Was just so-so for me. After reading many reviews, I had good expectations for this place, but it just didn't totally deliver."
373,"This is a very nice experience.  It's a great, elegant French cafe atmosphere.  The food is very good, including freshly baked bread and a great wine selection.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  The outdoor seating is very nice and has excellent views -- including of the Fountains of Bellagio -- but remember that you're sitting right on a main, heavily trafficked 6-lane road, with all the noise and pollution that comes with that.  (While the inside is beautiful, on a great day I'd still sit outside again though.)"
374,"Their food here is really quite good, however their customer accommodations are not so great. Hence the 3 star rating. We've been here numerous times and the food and service are both nearly perfect every time. However, accommodating customers in their very tiny bar (or the back bar, which is also small and often quite busy)while waiting for the remaining members of your party is a bit cramped and they won't budge on policy at all. If you're entire party is not at the host desk they won't seat you, even if you're just waiting for the elderly members of your party to walk through the casino to get to the restaurant. While I do understand their policy to some degree, I wish they had a, ""if the majority of your party is here we'll seat you"" policy instead. The food here is worth a little wait though, as they really do strive to be authentically french in sin city. Great steak and fish dishes, a good variety of wines to choose from and wonderful desserts make this a place worth visiting twice! Also, their porch makes for great people watching right in the heart of the Las Vegas strip!"
375,"I had higher expectation for this place, but was sadly disappointed. I've had better filet mignon, fries, and duck. The merlot butter left a dry aftertaste in my mouth that was not enjoyable. The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare so they get kudos for that. The duck my husband ordered was dry. The ambiance was romantic, but very crowded. The service was good. Overall, I don't think we'll be coming back to this place. If you still want to try this place out, I would recommend that you make reservation online because there is always a wait. You can even request where you want to sit (i.e. indoor, outdoor, window, etc.) and the front desk will try to accomodate you the best they can."
376,"Came here before going to see a show at the MGM.  Loved it!  Had a scallop appetizer, endive salad, and fillet Mignon.  The Gabitini (vodka martini with blue cheese olives) was delicious. We were lucky and got to sit right inside the windows facing the Bellagio fountain.  (Would have wanted to sit outside but it was COLD in Vegas).The service was charming and the food was wonderful.  I look forward to coming back someday!"
377,"I do love the view here. I am a people watcher and can view the whole strip and watch the Bellagio fountains. Plus, it's rare that I get my ""perfect weather day"" in Vegas so I bask outside whenever I can. I get very simple things here and they are good. I am a pate person- their country pate  and chicken liver mousse are happy pleasure of mine. (Me= bread and charcuterie whore). I usually just snack and dont commit to serious eats while watching people so thats my usual. Breakfast I've had the butterscotch waffles with poached pears and it was a nice topping...sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. I have not had dinner here yet. I've gone off trying most breakfast/lunch items, but I just keep it to those simple three usually...not that the other items are bad. Ive gotten a short rib cheese sammy, escargot, scallops gratinees, seafood crepe and enjoyed each. I just like French simplicity to go for the view."
378,"The server was good, atmosphere was wonderful and I was surrounded by great friends. My choice for lunch unfortunately did not stand out. I had a sandwich and it was basically a slice of toasted bread with roast beef, poached egg and spinach on the side. It also came with french fries which was the highlight of my meal. Maybe I am ordering all the wrong things but it was nothing special."
379,This is the best place to have lunch in Vegas on the strip. The Steak and fries is all you need.
380,"You have to sit out on the patio to have a wonderful experience. Otherwise, this place would get three stars.Champagne went well with my salmon dinner and complimentary French bread. It was good food, but not the best salmon I've had. My husband and I shared a delicious pear ice cream parfait for dessert. And the service was superb.The best part was watching the Bellagio fountain show from our outdoor seats. It was a lovely night and the show made it much more romantic."
381,"From looking at all the pictures on yelp, MAGR looked like a pretty casual  bistro feel eatery, but i guess at night it's oooh la la time! I made reservations for a group of 7 and we were seated within 15 minutes  at  round table in the corner.  It was the perfect spot!  when you look up, the celings are so high and the hanging lamps were very rustic looking! I loved that they sat us at a round table.  I hate when you have a large group and they seat you in a rectangle shaped table where you have to lean forward to talk or look at the person you are talking to.  FOOD:We started with the Country pate which was too course for my palate.  We were deciding between the Country or the Mousse, but we all thought the mousse would be too moussey ( is that a word?).  the flavor was spot on, however i would of liked the texture a little smoother.  It was hard to spread on the break because, well it doesn't really spread!The Escargots were very tasty and even better when you ask for extra bread and dip it in the left over garlic pesto sauce.  I think we asked for bread 3 times, and i over heard our waiter say to another waiter, they want MORE bread???  haha. Yes we like our french bread, is that a crime?  I ordered soup du jour which happened to be cream of garlic.  Could this be a better match for me?  I happen to love garlic so of course i had to order the soup.  It was so good that my two friends sitting on either side of me kept dipping their bread in my bowl!  I was happy to share... they gave such a huge bowl!For my entree i decided to go with the scallops gratin which was an appetizer, but by the time this arrived, I was already so full!  The scallops were VERY flavorful.  In every bite you can taste the caramelized onion, Gruyere, Parmesan, and garlic.  You however, don't really taste the scallops at all.  This is definitely an appetizer to share.  Eating four of these bad boys will leave our mouth thirsty for water the whole night!  this is definitly my kinda dish as i love all these flavors, but maybe one would suffice! =PI tried a few of the other dishes, seared scallops ( it was very fishy and very scallopy.  I would give this dish 2 *.), steak with herbed butter ( the steak was kinda thin and tough 3*).  Overall, the experience, ambiance, and food was pretty good.  I recommend this for those looking for a romantic restaurant at a good price ( sit outside and watch the bellagio fountain), or those with big groups looking to get a great value in Vegas!FYI Be careful of the paper covered table.  I got a huge paper cut from it!"
382,"When my party of 9 made dinner reservations for Mon Ami Gabi, we requested to be seated on the patio so we can catch a glimpse of the water show across the street at the Bellagio. Unfortunately, the desert gale force winds that night forced the patio dining area closed. The hostess was able to seat us even without the entre group present. The waiter was a great salesman. He talked the entire table into getting the raw oysters and shrimp platter to share and I'm glad he did. The raw oysters were so fresh and scrumptious that we ordered an extra plate of oysters. I had the porcini mushroom soup, which was make-you-want-to-lick-your-bowl good. However, that's where the positives ended. For a cocktail, I ordered their French Martini, which arrived room temperature and left a weird aftertaste in my mouth. It would have been much better chilled. For the main entrée, I had the Steak Roquefort (rare) and Frites. Firstly, the plate did not look very appetizing. It was a large, thin piece of meat with a glob of bleu cheese sauce in the middle and thinly cut fries haphazardly thrown on the side. Secondly, the meat was tough. If I had to order steak again, I would put in a few bucks more to get a real piece of meat like the Filet Mignon or the Bone-In Ribeye."
383,"We spent our 1-yr anniversary here... excellent service, tasty food.  We definately enjoyed ourselves. It was really noisy inside, but it made it feel less stuffy which was nice. The french onion soup & their warm bread was awsome.  The steaks were tasty, but lacked just a little in flavor. The coctails were very good!"
384,"For a Nevadan, I really try not to visit the strip that often. Just as when I lived in San Francisco, I try not to visit the touristy spot like the Pier, or Alcatraz (truth be told, I still haven't visited Alcatraz in my 3 years in the city). When I do visit the strip, it's either CE courses or business ventures. So when a colleague insisted on dining at this restaurant, I was skeptical of the quality of food here. I'm glad they proved me wrong. Here's why I enjoyed the experience and some tips: The outside dining area's view! Bellagio fountain and people watching paired with classic french cuisines and a great wine selection. Fantastic. I also love the multitude of heat lamps here because on a 55 degree night, my steak remained warm. And the steak. You have to go with the filet, rib-eye or NY strip if you want a true steak. The rest of the pretenders are pounded flat with a variety of sauces to choose from (definitely disappointing to look at). Another disappointment is that  they don't have a classic french dish Duck Confit (fatty duck preserved in marinated duck fat, then fried up in duck fat). So this restaurant is more Gabby than Gabi which isn't bad..."
385,"Excellent Service and food.We sat outside and were able to enjoy the Bellagio's fountain show while we were eating.My steak came out perfectly, and my wife loved her salmon. Excellent service, and our bill want that bad, considering we were eating directly on the strip.Bonus: Mon Ami Gabi is part of Lettuce Entertain You's Frequent Diner program, so we got points good for another dining experience."
386,"Mmmm...just looking at the pictures of the food we ordered still makes my tongue wag!First and foremost, I have got to thank all of the fellow yelpers for such an awesome find.  Everything was absolutely delish!Reservations is a must for this place regardless when you eat here because it's always crowded and the wait is super duper long.  I made my reservation 2 weeks prior to my trip to Vegas for lunch at 12:30.  I have also requested outdoor patio seating but there's no guarantees with reservations, you would still have to wait.  The atrium room seating isn't bad at all.  On the afternoon that we went, it was crazy windy so trash was flying all over the place and onto people's food and into their cups. The atrium room is small but right up against the window behind the patio which if weather is permitting, you can definitely enjoy your food with the Bellagio water show without the wind or trash blowing all over the place.The service was impeccable.  Our waitress was charming and had a great sense of humor.  She was super patient with us and accommodated us to the best that she can.  If we had questions, she answered honestly and didn't pressure us into ordering bad or pricey.For our lunch, we ordered the French onion soup, soup du jour (parsnip and roasted garlic), porcini mushroom soup, sea scallops gratinees, steak frites with brandy peppercorn, sandwich du jour (open faced sandwich with sliced roast beef with micro greens and poached egg), and classic quiche Lorraine.  All of the food we ordered was absolutely yumm.  There is no complaint here!  We also ordered from the wine cart they have.  It's a cart filled with a selection of red and whites and you can have a mini tasting from which ever wine is being offered.  Our waitress was very generous with the pouring and for $8 per glass depending on the wine is well worth it.This has definitely becoming a must for us everytime we play in Vegas!"
387,"It takes a lot for me to rate a restaurant a 5 star and this one I give a 4 but bordering on the 5. Absolutely fantastic. To start their dirty martinis with blue cheese stuffed olives are to die for, best I have had at any place. I have eaten here twice, most recently I had the New York Strip with peppercorn sauce and can I say WOW! Have the French onion soup to start and your meal is complete. Great service, great food! So why don't I give this a 5 you ask? Despite having reservation we had to wait a while to be seated, but hey, I was patient."
388,"We got an outside table where my friend could watch the Bellagio fountain while I dig into my yummy steak with skinny fries...fair prices for good food, a place to rest your feet and people watch, good service, could do a lot worse in Vegas"
389,"I really, REALLY wanted to give this place five stars. Maybe even more than five. But we got hit by such a huge downer at the end of the night that it killed my enthusiasm.The boyfriend and I had been having a wonderful night, and wanted to eat somewhere good that wouldn't break the bank. We'd just finished watching the Bellagio fountains, and Mon Ami Gabi was right across the street and just what I wanted.We sat inside, but right by the windows facing the strip and the Bellagio fountains. We got the great view without the crowd noise, smoke, and wind. Perfect atmosphere for our romantic evening.We both went for the steak frites: steak bordelaise (red wine reduction and carmelized onions) for me, steak roquefort (blue cheese) for the boyfriend.The original plan was for us to each eat half of out steak and switch plates. After a few bites of mine, I decided that was just not going to happen, because I liked mine too much!The preparations were simple. Flank steak or something like that pounded thin, with the sauce or what you chose on top. Thin cut fries that I couldn't stop snacking on. It looked like too much when it got placed in front of me, but I ended up finishing it all!But alas, our happiness couldn't last long. Our waitress was near impossible to get ahold of once the entrees were served. I wish I could give her name here, but the nametags were numbered. Not much of a name tag, I guess.I finished a few minutes before my boyfriend, and started looking around for her to get the dessert menu. I still had room for some creme brulee!Five minutes later, the boyfriend finished. I glimpsed the waitress by the bar, chatting up some other servers... and checking Facebook on her iPhone!Eventually she came our way... with a large group that she started fawning all over. They ordered lots of wine, and a few appetizers. My boyfriend and I weren't quite so spendy, so maybe that's why we got put on the back burner?This is about fifteen minutes after I finished eating, and ten since our plates had been cleared. My boyfriend and I were clearly bored and waiting, but only the bussers came by to refill our waters.Almost twenty minutes of waiting later, the boyfriend decided that we are not asking for a dessert menu if she doesn't offer, and certainly not leaving a tip. I absolutely hate not leaving something, but I had never been so angry about service in my life so I agreed.Waitress finally comes, and offers dessert. If I didn't have a huge creme brulee craving, I would have been ready to walk. I got my dessert and my boyfriend got Bananas Foster.My dessert was good, but it's not like you can mess up creme brulee. My boyfriend's dessert was huge, but he said it could have used more bananas. Still, he cleared his plate.We booked it as soon as she got us our check. We had really been having a wonderful evening, one I won't forget, but the horrible service left a bad taste in my mouth. I really hope it's an anomaly, because I may come here again my next trip to Vegas."
390,"Good service? Check.View of the Bellagio water show from a patio seat on an early Spring night? Check.Yummy hot baguette, with pickled carrots and butter? You bet'cha. Delicious French classics such as escargot, onion soup au gratin, and Boeuf Bourguignon? Triple Check. We had a great time at Mon Ami Gabi. Service was on-point, food - super yummy, and the view was unforgettable! Great way to kick off the weekend in Vegas."
391,"I felt like I was transported to a cozy, intimate cafe in France.  The service was excellent and our waiter offered us a wine tasting to find the perfect glass of red. The French Onion Soup, Roast Chicken and Grilled Salmon were fabulous. Try sitting outside so you can watch the Bellagio water show."
392,"Ah, Mon Ami Gabi. What can I say?  Well let's see..................Mon Ami Gabi is our go to restaurant whenever any friends or family from out of town show up on our doorstep.  The food is always excellent, the service for the most part is always top rate and mostly it is the French Vibe the place gives off. If however, French Vibes are not your thing, go for the food anyway. The restaurant consists of basically 3 rooms. The back room is a bit on the dark side where you can imagine Victor Hugo sitting and enjoying a glass of Absinthe (sorry, not available here) and writing his next great masterpiece. The front room is very light and airy where you can imagine Truffault and Deneauve discussing their next cinematic project  over an amusing Beaujolais. The best of the three is the outdoor patio, which has to be the best patio dining in Las Vegas. Pure Paris.....Fresh air, the fountains of Bellagio with music across the street and a constant stream of people to observe and try and figure out.  Be warned that no reservations are accepted for the patio, so a brief wait may be in store, but if time is important you can reserve a table indoors.Food, Oh yes.............They do serve it. You can not go wrong with any of the 3 Steak Frites versions. The French onion soup is to die for as are the Scallops.  Salads and Quiches are also excellent , and any of the desserts will please. They have quite an extensive Wine List, but if You ask for the House Wine which is kind of hidden on the list You will get a Bottle from Louis Latour or George Duboeuf depending on your preference.We were there on opening day and I can't even count how many times since. By Las Vegas prices, it is a place you can bring company to and still have a couple of bucks left to try your luck in the casino. Bon Appetite."
393,"I had Sunday brunch here with my always attractive dining companion while on a recent trip to Vegas, and it was probably the highlight of the trip.It was a beautiful day, and we were seated outside in front of the Bellagio fountains. The atmosphere would have been worth four stars alone, but the food and service were both great. We split a breakfast sandwich and a fruit tray. Both were delicious, and the fruit tray had some of the best cantaloupe I've eaten in recent memory. We also had a couple of mimosas, which were a bit overpriced (but it's Vegas). Prices were quite reasonable considering the setting. I can't wait to come back and try this place for lunch or dinner next time I'm in town."
394,"After my disappointing buffet experience at Monte Carlo the night before, I was looking forward to breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi.  It's right next to the Eiffel Tower at Paris.  There's lots of indoor seating, but the best place to sit is outside.  Fresh air, people-watching and a great view of the Bellagio and the water show!I came for Sunday brunch and got a table outside.  I had a delicious blueberry waffle topped with lots of fresh blueberries with warm blueberry syrup and whipped cream on the side.  I added a side of the crispiest bacon I've ever had.  Seriously, be careful if your teeth are prone to chipping.  The bacon is also sweet, so not tops in my book but good for those of you who like it that way.  No mimosas or bloody marys for me, but I did have a cappuccino and a cafe latte.  Both were good, but maybe a tad on the weaker side.  I mean I had no caffeine high at all!I heard the steak is amazing here so I'll have to come back for dinner sometime."
395,"Outdoor seating location is probably the best on the strip.  However, beware of the steak sandwich.  Seems like the meat came straight out of the fridge... cold, unbooked and no taste."
396,"Yum, yum, yum. It was a gorgeous day last Monday when I was on the strip, so my friend and I decided to look for a place to have lunch outside. Mon Ami Gabi looked happening, so we popped into the Paris and added our name to the list. Our wait was supposed to be 35 minutes for a patio seat, but really it turned out to be more like 15. The hostess told me she didn't want to be at work as she was walking us to our table, which I thought was a little odd, but I couldn't blame her. It was a beautiful day. Our waiter was on-point. He was attentive but not over-bearing. The French bread came out hot and delicious. And the butter was room temperature - something that is key and that most places don't do. Split the loaf with my friend and had a happy start to the meal.The menu had lots of delicious-sounding options, but I settled on the seafood crepe while my friend ordered the open-face shrimp salad sandwich with avocado. When our food came out, my friend and I switched. She hates celery and there was a lot of it in this shrimp salad. There was also a lot of shrimp and red pepper. Yum. And it wasn't too mayonnaise-y. I thought the bread under the salad was a little useless, since it got soggy, and the giant lettuce pieces were a little difficult to eat. I also didn't quite see how the avocado fit in, but I was happy to eat it. Overall, I found it yummy. The fries it came with were more like potato crisps (like the chips in the grocery store). So-so, but nothing I'd munch on regularly.What was even yummier, though, was that seafood crepe. Holy moly. The scallops were perfect - buttery, charred on one side, and just yum. The shrimp were also grilled yumminess. There was a fair portion of seafood on the crepe. The sauce really made the dish, though. I can't even describe it other than yum, heaven, something I'd like to drink from a glass. It was thick-ish and buttery. And the peas were a perfect touch. The only complaint: The menu said the crepe came with a salad. It was more like 3 pieces of lettuce tucked on the side of the plate.My friend is huge on dessert, so she ordered the profiterole trio. The caramel ice cream was delicious. The vanilla and chocolate were also good. The fudge sauce drizzled over the dish was heaven. And the profiteroles/pastries were airy, crisp and yummy.I thought the lunch prices were really reasonable for Vegas. $12 for the shrimp salad and $15-17 for the crepe. The view of the Bellagio water show made this lunch even better."
397,"Mon Ami Gabi is a French restaurant in the Paris hotel. We ended up booking some early reservations there on a night when we had no dinner plans, and were SO pleased with our dinner. We ended up getting out to eat on the patio, no problem. It was rather crowded, but we still had a good view of the Bellagio fountains. They also have heat lamps, which made it cozy since it was a little chilly outside.I love bread so much that sometimes I fill up on it before my entree comes out. It was very difficult not to do that with Mon Ami Gabi's bread! The bread was delicious, and the butter was AMAZING. I said to my husband, ""This is like...super butter."" Very very buttery and yummy. Phenomenal.I selected the skate fish for my entree and my husband selected the beef bourguinon. I thought the skate was very good - well prepared and light. The beef bourguinon was INCREDIBLE, though. Tender beef that must have simmered in the sauce for 12 hours. Rich and delicious.We were stuffed by the time dessert came around. Looking back, we really didn't eat a lot - we didn't get any appetizers or dessert, but it remains one of the most satisfying meals I've had. The service was outstanding, as well."
398,"Yum Yum Yum! This place is almost the only reason I spend 4 hours behind the wheel driving to Vegas. I've eaten here for lunch and dinner on many occasions for several years now. I've never had a bad meal here. Except the time we were seated right under the vent, which was very nippy.  Every time I go to Vegas, I have to eat at Mon Ami Gabi at least twice during my stay. LOVE THIS PLACE!"
399,"Umm, awesome. We had Sunday brunch and it was absolutely delicious. We sat outside on the patio and had a great view of the strip. We liked it so much we made reservations and came back that night for dinner. We tried the ""Olive Jar"" as an appetizer, along with some mussels. I had the skate fish and she had the scallops. Though the skate was salty, it was the first time I had it. For dessert, I forgot what it was, but it was great. I was drinking a little too much wine at this point to remember anything other than ""cannot stop eating."" The service can be a tad slow and the place can be a bit crowded, but I will definitely come back again!"
400,You can't beat the location and the lively vibe here.The food was alright but I've had much better elsewhere on the Strip.
401,"I love this restaurant!! My friends and I were staying at Paris and we decided we wanted to come here for dinner for my friend Sharmendra's birthday. We came on a Tuesday night  and it was pretty crowded. We thought that we would have to wait but we ended up getting seated right away. It was dark which gave the restaurant a very intimate ambiance. As we were seated, we were greeted right away and someone took our drinks. After about sitting for 15 minutes, our server came to to greet us. After taking our orders, we waited another 15 to 20 minutes to get our food. I had ordered the Sea Seared Scallops. They were quite delectable! I had never tasted anything like this in my life! I was very satisfied with the quality. My friend Jennifer ordered the Hangover Steak, which she thought was divine. Michelle had ordered the French Onion Soup and the Crab Cakes. She was very content with what she had ordered. Sharmendra ordered the Grilled Salmon and Spinach Salad. It looked so good from afar and he agreed. We were all pleased with our food selections. I would have given this place 5 stars, but the service was not all that great. Our server only returned once after we had received our food and he wasn't that friendly. But overall, the food was very delightful and the atmosphere was very relaxing."
402,"I don't think I've been to Mon Ami Gabi for a couple of years, and I actually don't think I've ever been there and picked up the check myself.  My girlfriend had never been before, so I finally took her last night on the way home from picking her up at the airport.The ambiance is great... in inside is classy, and if you can score it, the outside patio has a great view.  The food is also great, of course.  My girlfriend had the trout, which was the best trout I've ever tried.  I had the steak classic for a change from the filet, and it was much tastier than I expected.  We also shared a glass of frangria (French sangria).The bill was $51.72 after tax, which is pretty good for this type of establishment.  Our service wasn't perfect as we were originally handed lunch menus, and then when we got dinner menus, they didn't come back for awhile.  But I've been here before, so that's just an isolated incident.I'm upgrading Mon Ami Gabi to 5 stars because it's a great deal for what you get!"
403,"Mon ami, indeed!  We wanted a nice breakfast before heading out to the Hoover Dam, so we bypassed the buffet and came to Mon Ami.  We got the crepes and quiche... and lots and lots of coffee.  Our server was fantastic and the room is just charming.  It was a lovely way to start our day.  That same night, we were hungry, but not starving.  Where to go?  Back to Mon Ami Gabi!  We grabbed two stools at the bar and ordered the amazing French onion and a warm baguette.  Perfect!  Also perfect?  My bourbon and Coke was only $6.  It was hard to find just a soda for that price in Vegas, let alone a perfectly mixed drink.  Well done, my friend."
404,"One of my good friends recommended this place before I left for Vegas.  I'm glad I've went there.  To get the outside patio there was a hour wait.  We said that's ok, we can sit inside, so we were seated right away.  They walked us all the way close to the patio where the cover was.  That was pretty good too.  We were surprised that we got to sit there.  You don't get the outside breeze that day and you get all the natural sun light.  GF had the salad and the soup of the day.  I had the escargot and sliced duck sandwich special.  Soup of the day wasn't great, but my escargot and sandwich was great.  Service again was good too.  If you can get there early to outside seating during the summer, you should do it.  That day was pretty windy, so we made the right choice by sitting inside."
405,"Late last night after a couple drinks, and winning a hundred bucks on the sex and the city slot machine (I guess people do actually win on that machine)....my boyfriend and 2 of our friends decided to eat here. Our friends work at Paris and are regulars of Mon Ami Gabi, but it was a first time experience for me and my boyfriend. To start out, the view is great! Even though I work at the Bellagio, I never really get to view the fountain show from across the street. Everyone made me choose the bottle of wine for the table for some strange reason, and although my wine knowledge is limited I went with a 2005 Bordeaux blend and everyone loved it. We started out with a couple appetizers to share and let me tell you how seriously delicious the escargot was! They were oven roasted in a garlic herb butter and just melt in your mouth. We also tried (much to my hesitation) the chicken liver mousse and I don't know much about pate or liver (except that mine is probably mad at me), but it had such an incredible flavor. They brought complimentary warm rosemary seasoned olives to the table, and if I weren't so excited about filet mignon, I would have been completely satisfied right then and there.But, then came my perfectly cooked medium rare filet mignon drizzled with a merlot butter and I was the happiest girl in the world! I reluctantly shared half of my steak with my boyfriend, but we both decided that next time we will come hungrier and get out own cuts. Our server was great and so knowledgeable about every little detail.We finished the night with after-dinner drinks and good conversation. I slept so well last night :)"
406,"The food here is terrific. I'm knocking off a star because I felt like we were seated in a wind tunnel. We were inside, close to the patio doors, and the weather outside kept us from enjoying our meal. Service was fairly good, although we were amused by out waitress constantly touching someone in our party every time she came by. Apparently she read that if you touch your patron they'd tip more, but since she didn't know who was going to pay the bill she wasn't going to take any chances so she touched us all."
407,"I am excited to be the 500th person to review this location.  I feel like someone should throw some confetti on me!Mon Ami Gabi is originally from Chicago and was really excited when they built a location here on the Strip.  Over the years I have dragged my of my co-workers from around the world to this place and it is not uncommon for use to eat here several times during a business trip.  The food, service and drinks are just amazing.  This is one of the best thinly pounded steaks you can get anywhere.  I like the one topped with blue cheese, in fact I do not even look at the menu anymore.  Just bring it to me Medium Rare...in fact I have gotten my steak within 5 minutes of ordering...they are that fast.  Chef Ramsey would not have to worry about pushing out orders here.Other benefits of this location.  The outdoor patio on the Strip is just amazing with views of the Dancing water show at the Bellagio.  There are no reservations taken for seating here, so come early or late or just wait!  When I come here by myself I like to eat at the bar...there are two bars...one in front and one right by the outdoor patio.  I feel like a regular here because the bartenders have gotten to know me over the years...makes me feel like home but I do not even live here.  Speaking of the bar...make sure you get your martini's with the blue cheese stuffed olives...so good!  But be careful because people at your table will steal them.We tried something new here this week for desert...the white chocolate bread pudding...it was so yummy...I have never liked bread pudding but this was out of this world.Everything about this place makes this the best restaurant in Las Vegas!"
408,"We LOVED this restaurant.  Great food, great ambiance, great server!  We will definately be back!  The three cheese plate was outstanding and has my mouth watering 2 weeks later!  The Bananas Foster crepe was huge and sugary and delicious!"
409,"What is more perfect than enjoying a nice lunch and coctails on the patio overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio fountains? The scenery couldn't be better, that's for sure. The drinks were great (everything's better with a little champagne!), although they did take awhile to get out to us. Our lunches were both devoured, a chicken blt and shrimp open face sandwich, both with frittes. They could have only given us one serving of the frittes cause they were HUGE and not really my fave anyways. Our server was overall pretty slow, but the rest of the experience made up for it. Not really that pricy all things considered either."
410,"This was a perfect spot for dinner before a show on Saturday night.  We had a 7pm reservation, and had to wait a few minutes while they caught up, but we were in and out within an hour.  The decor was very understated...I can't say that it resembled Paris, but it looked like a nice New York steakhouse in the early 20th century (in my imagination, anyway).  Sadly, we could not see the Bellagio fountain from our seat inside the restaurant, despite asking for it on our www.opentable.com reservation.  But our experience was otherwise very positive.Wine by the glass was reasonably priced, and earned a hefty pour.  The bottles were familiar favorites, well chosen.  The menu is very traditional - your steak house usual suspects.  We both got the filet mignon, so I cannot speak to their standard steaks.   The filets were more than 8oz each, and perfectly cooked (my medium rare was like butter).  The hubby got his with bleu cheese - I order with the merlot butter.  Both were delicious, perfectly seasoned options.  The steaks themselves were unadulterated.  The fries were nearly flat - somewhere between a potato chip and a fry, as other reviewers have commented.  I personally loved them (and you get a ton), but I suppose it's a matter of taste.  They were very crispy, and not at all oily.  Give 'em a shot!  We also got an order of green beans, which my husband totally ignored, but were perfectly cooked and an excellent vegetable accompaniment.  Bread was lovely and warm, and served in a paper bag with butter and some sort of slaw that we overlooked.  It was OK (the slaw, that is).Our waiter was extremely efficient and still affable, though not terribly friendly.  He was kind enough to take a photo for us, and made sure we were comfortable.  The people next to us were very odd, and one appeared to be obscenely drunk, but hey - it's Vegas.  Had they had a few more vegetable sides available, and perhaps a few original steak preparations, I would have given them 5 stars easily.  As it was, Mon Ami Gabi gets my full recommendation, and though Las Vegas is full of tasty restaurants, this reasonably priced and delicious steakhouse gets an honorable mention in my book."
411,"Brunch, Brunch, Brunch. Make reservations. Best eggs Benedict in the area. The bloddy mary bar need I say more. I decided to make my self a bloody Hormel, I decided to name it that for all the hormel bacon I put in my drink. Belvedere Vodka, Bacon(4 Strips), woustershire, horseradish(hand grated) tobasco and a splash of Clamatoe Juice. I could hae bathed in it.Do it just do it."
412,This was the perfect place for a Vacation day in out home town. Mussles and frite's with a cold Chimay and Kettle Dirty w/Blue cheese stuffed olives. Just sat at the bar and enjoyed the company of 99 and 86 our dedicated bartenders.
413,"Ask for a view of the fountains when you make your reservation. It doesn't hurt, and it seemed to have helped us out at least. Daily fish specials are available here. On Friday night, it was Dover Sole with a light lemon, caper, butter sauce, served over slighted wilted spinach and with a side of mini roasted red potatoes. The place smacks me from the sidewalk as a tourist trap. It's located right across the street from the Bellagio fountains, the outdoor patio is situated right on the sidewalk, and it's a giant space. However, the food is amazing, and it rightly deserves the number of stars that 500+ people have given. Plan ahead if you're able to. We had a reservation (booked 2 wks in advance) and waltzed right in. There was a line of 6+ people at all times in the non-reservation line throughout the night."
414,"Pros - friendly service, great food, great location, great view of Las Vegas BlvdCons - none (can you believe it?  NONE!)I really don't have anything bad to say about this place!  It's amazing.  I've eaten here multiple times and it never fails to impress.  Funny thing, I've only eaten here for brunch and never for dinner.My all time favorite is the eggs benedict.  Ask for smoked salmon instead of the Canadian bacon.  They'll happily replace it for you.  The english muffin is fluffy and delicious.  The hash browns is a nice touch.  The LGO is great as well...healthy and delicious!To be honest, I'm worried that my best kept secret will become popular knowledge resulting in over popularization and a decline in quality and service.  Do me a favor...don't go here!"
415,"I really liked this restaurant. I went here for dinner and right from the beginning the experience was great. We didn't arrive in time for the first-come-first-serve patio seating, but since we had made reservations, we were seated bordering the glass window and the deck. This means that we got a full view of what everyone else sees from the deck, which is the beautiful Bellagio fountain/water show and all the people walking by. We ordered the scallops with the whipped cauliflower and spinach and we ordered the Steak Au Poivre - brandy peppercorn sauce with fritas. The scallops were very flavorful, but a bit overcooked (still great). The steak was a bit too thin and the fries a little too salty, but also both were good. We also tried the french onion soup, which was delicious. It's one of the best that I've ever had.The service was great and the prices were reasonable. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone going to Vegas. Make a reservation though so that you can get a better ""outside"" seating seat. It's one of the only places with an outdoor seating area next to Cabo Wabo."
416,"I finally made it back here and was pleasantly surprised by the consistency of the food. Arriving on a Saturday night at 6:15pm, the two of us decided to take a seat at the bar and have a couple cocktails and an app. There are two bars in this place and you'll want to sit at the bar waaaay inside the restaurant. This is the one that has the view of the patio and the Bellagio fountains.The bartenders were courteous and efficient in a restaurant that was very busy. the blue cheese stuffed olives were delicious in my Kettle martini and the mussels and frites were the perfect accompaniment. The bar is a great place to people watch but I wouldn't linger around too long since there's a constant flow of new guests arriving and waiting for their reservations at the bar. It's a great place to start an evening before a show or a walk down the Strip."
417,"What a great experience. My father and I went for my birthday - we usually hit up a steakhouse, as I'm a steak LOVER - was a challenge trying to find one that got solid reviews, but then Mon Ami Gabi fell into my lap, we made the reservation and fell in love with the steak. Great wine selection, best of all the waitstaff was trained on how to pair the wine with the food selection. The food came quick, but not too quick (didn't feel rushed), and the environment was fun, casual, but classy as well. I would recommend Mon Ami Gabi for dates, good food, birthdays, or if you just want a classy meal. I also love that the restaurant is located across from the Bellagio and if you sit outside you have an incredible view of the water show. Enjoy! It's worth it!"
418,one of my favorite restaurants.  Love to visit Gabi.  the baguette is extraordinary.  the butter is out of this world.  breakfast is outstanding.
419,"MAG Restaurant provides the BEST location in Vegas for dining! Outdoor dining means watching the tourists walking down LV Blvd, but also enjoying the fountains at Bellagio! Hard to get in, but the food is great and the service impeccable. My wife and I love taking our friends here from out of town. Make sure you visit MAG!"
420,This restaurant is absolutely fantastic. The price is very reasonable for the exquisiteFood and the spectacular view of the strip at night. The three cheeses with tomato sauce appetizer is to die for! I also enjoyed their mussel appetizer very much!  Escargot was okay. So...so.... but the ambiance was spectucular.... right in front of the bellagio with the watershow... I would dine there again
421,"Believe it or not, my friends and I got a recommendation for Mon Ami Gabi from our cab driver! On our cab ride from the airport to the hotel, the cab driver was giving us a song and dance about being able to get us into the clubs, so while he was on a roll, my friend asked him where he would recommend to eat. It was interesting to hear what he said even though we had all been to Vegas before.Am I glad we listened to him! He told us to check out Mon Ami Gabi around 2:30pm for lunch in order to catch the 3pm fountain show at the Bellagio. We went on Sunday around 2:15pm and asked for a table outside on the rail (like the cabbie told us to ask for). They told us it would be a 45 minute wait especially for a table outside. But it turned into more like 30 minutes. We killed time at the casino ; ) Everything was perfect, except that is was SOOOO sunny and hot on this particular day, so we ended up rushing through our meal due to the fact that the seats ""on the rail"" have to cover above. Even with that, the service was perfect, the waitress was polite and fast and the food...was AMAZING. Two of us got the same sandwich special and my other friend got one of the club sandwiches. We all liked our food. Yum! The sandwich I had was chicken with pesto, grilled red peppers and yummy cheezy-ness! YUM!The lunch prices were surprisingly reasonable for such good service and food, $9-$15! Seeing (and hearing) the Bellagio water show was so fun!My recommendation is:1) During the day, ask to sit outside, but under and umbrella!Or2) Go for a super late lunch or early dinner when the sun is lower in the sky or dark : ) It must be beautiful then!Highly recommend it, but if you need a very specific time, call ahead and make a reservation so you get to see the show! Check out times here:Monday - Friday3:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. - show every 1/2 hour8:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. - show every 15 minutesSaturdays, Sundays and Holidays12:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. - show every 1/2 hour8:00 p.m. - 12:00 a.m. - show every 15 minutes"
422,"I have to say, I was wayyy impressed!The BF and I arrived in Vegas Saturday morning and the first thing we did was rush our asses to Mon Ami Gabi because he has been raving and ranting about how delish this place is. I was skeptical, but his stomach has good taste, so I went along.We got there around 10:15am and was told we'd have a 30 minute wait, which meant they couldn't guarantee us the breakfast menu (which ends at 11am). Poo. He really wanted the eggs benedict.BUT we were seated in about 15 minutes in a cozy little corner of the patio. Our server promptly got our drink orders (coffee for me and mimosas for both). She took our orders and didn't even flinched when the BF asked for smoked salmon in his eggs and I replaced the turkey in my omelette with mushrooms. The omelette was AMAZING! They put chives and cilantro on it which gave it an extra kick and made it tastier than I could've possible imagined up myself. Apparently the BF's eggs were so good he polished off his entire plate (what a fatty =P). To top it off, the waitress gladly gave me a to go cup of a refill of coffee to send us on our way.Great food, perfect service.. this place definitely deserves 5 stars!!"
423,"I've always wanted to try this place every time that I've walked passed it on the strip, and I finally did!  Thanks to a business lunch that was all paid for.I came in still feeling wasted from the night before and having had 1 hour of sleep, so I don't know if I can rate this place correctly.  I ordered a bacon burger and I must say it was pretty bomb.  I ordered it well done and I liked the texture.  Even the bread was good.  The fries were as thin as onion strings and crispy; just the way I like 'em.Unfortunately this was all I could eat because my mind was in a different place (probably my bed), and my body was not functioning normally.  Overall I liked the joint and would come back another time for lunch or dinner, but this time when I'm in perfect shape.... I'm not sure when that will ever happen considering this is in Vegas, haha."
424,03/22/10-8:30pm. Told wait would be 45 mins.  Went back. Told it would be another 20 mins. Waited by front door and heard several groups of 2-6 people tell the seating guy they didn't have a reservation how long would it be. They were seated before us. When I complained the seating guy said their party was for six. Uh no. You seated a table of 2 then a party of 3.  We were finally seated almost 2 hours after we originally got there. Was the food worth it? Hmmmm....  No. The steaks were paper thin. Why bother asking how we want it cooked?  The French fries were greasy and cold. The luke warm soup was not that good.  The best part of the meal was the bread.  5 stars for the great bread.  The service was 3 stars.
425,"Had lunch twice while on a weekend business trip. I wished I would have had all my meals here. Although not perfect, they do a fantastic job in a very busy mileu. Day one I had the French Onion soup, my personal benchmark for a restaurant. Wow. The portion was generous, the gruyere delicious and the soup itself richly flavored without being salty (are you listening Thomas Keller?) The french bread was likewise great. The signature steak frites was tasty, though the very thin cut made my rare order somewhat relative. I ate almost all of the frites (french fries) at great risk to my cardiovascular health. Although I was not remotely hungry afterwards, I ordered the bread pudding. It was a little non-traditional, more like a sponge cake with caramel sauce , but excellent for what it was. I came back the next day and brought a friend. The sole special was past its freshness peak and my artichoke soup could have been warmer. Had I had more time I would have sent it back, but such was not the case. My lunch partner was pleased with his beef sandwich. Finally, the waitstaff was great, very friendly and efficient. There are a number of secondary dining room managers on the prowl also keeping things running smooth. The only other place I have had this level of service recently was in the Brennan family restaurants in New Orleans."
426,"Their chicken wowed me. It was as good as the chicken that I had in Paris, very juicy and tender.The ambiance is very French and cozy, too. We had a table in the balcony, and it was very nice having a dinner with Bellagio's fountain shows every 15 mintues.I absolutely recommend this restaurant to my friends."
427,"So I decided I wanted to take my BF out to a nice lunch, I of course went to my handy dandy yelp app on my phone. We got waiter #32 he gave us some amazing recommendations (I think that he should be promoted to a tag with his name instead of his number) We started off with the Country Pate it was impressive , I've had better though. Then with the recommendation of our waiter i had the scallops AMMMAAAZIINNGG. I then ordered the escargot. WOW!! The sauce it comes with was so good i was wetting my bread in it to, it was perfectly buttery and garlicky. if i couldve licked the plate i would've. :)  We also had a pitcher of frangria their version of sangria so awesome. My bf had the steak cant remember the name but the sauce was wow amazing perfectly cooked, the waiter was really attentive and kept checking on us. Would bring us fresh bread whenever our was out. We were stuffed so really werent sure if we wanted to have desert, our waiter recommended the bread pudding. Now mind you I HATE bread pudding and so does my bf, but we decided to go out on a limb, WOW OH WOW!!!!!!!!!!! MUST HAVE, one of the best deserts I've had. The ambiance was really enjoyable we people watched and enjoyed the breeze and the sun. Over all experience AMMMAAAZZZIIIINNNGGG!!! Definitely will be back for brunch!"
428,"Perfect view, perfect table, perfect food, perfect company....perfect meal!Seven of us were seated at the table on the outside corner of the patio with the BEST VIEW of the Bellagio fountains.  A better location for viewing the fountains would be floating above the sidewalk, but I think that's about it!  We had reservations, but forgot to specifically ask for a patio table.  We arrived for our reservation and asked, and it was only a 10 minute wait! For the best table on the patio, no less!I'm amazed that our meal was only $45 each (including tax and tip).  That would include: Pitcher of ""Fran""griaAppetizers (to share):half dozen oysters- come with shallots in vinegar, lemon, and cocktail sauce.  a bit on the small size, but perfectly delicioushomemade potato chips (I forget the fancy name) -so good.three cheese plate- delectable.  we also went through five or six of their demi baguettes....Individual Entree:I got the scallops and they were DIVINE.  I even enjoyed the spinach that came with it.  Even the spinach!Dessert (to share):Apple Tartin- my favorite dessert! (and believe me, it was hard to choose...)Chocolate Mousse- chocolate and decadentPear parfait- i don't even like pears, i loved thisBread pudding- caramel-y and amazingOur waiter was hilarious and prompt, and a great photographer too boot (group photo while the fountains were on was great).I cannot say enough good things about this place!"
429,"Yelpers (and then the waiter) steered me wrong here......do not order the house wine under any circumstance. It's truly undrinkable. It's the DeBeouf with a red flower ($2/bottle in your local corner deli) on the label hidden under the MAG name. Also, can't understand why everyone was so excited about the bread. It's pretty basic, but good I guess? Maybe it's just exciting to get something free in Vegas!The oysters on the half shell saved the day! They were sweet, fresh and the traditional presentation is lovely.The NY steak frites was meh. A bit over-cooked and bland, but not awful. I've had much better at Outback, yes Outback, really. The fries were nice however our April night in 'Paris' was chilly and they got cold instantly on my cold plate. I'd come back for the oysters, a glass of champagne and a show or two from the Bellagio fountains across the street. The people watching and fountain show view is all time. My man and I enjoyed ourselves and the decent service."
430,"I wanted to try a place I have never been to before, and  noticed how many reviews this place got.  So my wife and I gave it a shot.AND...it definitely deserves CINCO ESTRELAS!!!1. Food- I have been to some really nice steakhouses in Las Vegas, and I must say that the ""Roquefort Steak and Frites"" was one of the best  steaks I have ever had. It was PERFECT!2. Service-  The restaurant was busy, and a lot of people were waiting outside to be seated.  I suggest making reservations! As soon as we arrived and said we had reservations, we were seated.Our Waiter- Eventhough we didnt understand everything he said, his service made up for that. As soon as I finished my starter salad, our main course was on the table. There was never a moment waiting for food or a refill, my water glass was never empty the whole night.3.TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!!!  AMAZING!!!"
431,"Wait was over a hour and half, food and view were great until the next day when my mother and I both got food poisoning. The only thing we shared and ate together the whole day was the ceaser salad, so it must have been the egg or lettuce. Needless to say the rest of our Vegas trip was ruined and I'm still recovering 3 days later. I'm so skeeved out!"
432,"I am not into French food per se but man o man! Delish! Of course they had a great wine selection. I had the fish special which was trout. I am VERY picky about fish - I don't like to order it away from the coast but LV is the exception. I also usually only like ahi, swordfish etc. ""safe fish"". I was feeling adventurous and at the coaxing of a local (aka my Aunt) ordered with much reservation. I have been thinking about that meal for 2 week and as I am in LV once again- I am going back. The salads were great...I had a nice spinach salad. Also- they have a niceeee Rose wine. NOT white zin blechhhh. The real deal is nice. Perfect for a warm evening dinner when you don't want white, you don't want red. People that know what I am saying know what I am saying here. By the way, if you are looking at my reviews and saying oh she gives high marks to everyone...I don't. I just don't have time to comment on all the mediocre spots. So if I write about something its because it should be written about."
433,"mon ami did not live up to the expectations formed from a previous visit...had dinner here a couple of years ago...and the food was very good (i had the french onion soup and skate...my friend had a salad, hanger steak and fries)...this time around, i was a bit let down by the quality/taste of the food and service...albeit, it was very busy...but they do have a huge number of staff members that should be equipped to handle large crowds...maybe it was just a bad day...french onion soup:  wasn't quite warm enough (the cheese was starting to harden a bit and thought it could have used a bit of sherry)http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=hflQyxOfAZyK3km7yeL5dAhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=hflQyxOfAZyK3km7yeL5dAfrench endive and poach egg salad:  light vinaigrette, fresh endive...lovely...can't resist a perfectly poached egg with a runny center...yum!!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=pi0CUfuOae5Uo7cFqBj-_ghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=Rwfmeq8hxuvYChrDWEatwghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=PWfkT5PQHGxMR0h28T0Z_whash brown:  it was okay...not very crispy...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=da9NftqMPa6Bp-pkLAL5AQbeef bourguignon:  also just okay...looked somewhat dried out and had an unappealing hue to it...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=ztBkK5d6runbB-CC3ZMsIghttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=UebY0IV9oCbdgPK00WrkXgconsidering my great first experience here, the delicious endive salad, and the location/convenience...i'm going to give mon ami 3 stars..."
434,I finally got to have dinner here and everything was a great experience!  We celebrated a birthday here with a group of 6 people and we had made reservations and were lucky enough to have it near enough the patio that we were able to view the Bellagio water show during dinner!The girls started out with a martini that had grey goose and champagne and I think something else too which was really good! The escargot was delicious!  It was in a pesto sauce which can out nice and hot!  The brie and garlic starter was also very delicious and it was really good with the fresh baguettes they had as well!  I had the rib eye and lots of different sides and everything was good! I love to eat my meat medium rare and it's hard to find places that actually make it medium rare! It's always more medium than it is rare but Mon Ami Gabi did a great job! The meat was tender and very flavorful.
435,Surprisingly good - almost authentic French Bistro feel. I had a filet- rare. Was cooked exactly as I requested.  Service was attentive. Good experience.
436,"Mon Ami Gabi is my all-time favorite restaurant in the world.  I'm from Los Angeles, so visits to Las Vegas are quite frequent for me.  Although the glitz and glam of Vegas have attracted some of the world's top chefs, I'm sure none of them expected to be beat by a chain restaurant like Mon Ami Gabi.The service at Mon Ami is incredibly great.  Of all the times that I've dined here, about 95% of my visits were great.  The food, the wait staff (Angie & Misty, love ya babes) and their bartender (Rick) are some of the most pleasant to have serving you.My recommendations for this restaurant are the followingAppetizer: Escargots (The best I've ever had)Entree: Filet Mignot w/ Merlot Butter (Done Blue or Rare)Dessert: Flourless Chocolate Cake (One of a kind)If you're not daring enough for snails, I'd recommend the Shrimp Gabi.  Also, if the Flourless Chocolate Cake is not available, I'd recommend their Bread Pudding in it's place.Drink RecommendationsMen: Orange Whip (Only Available Here @ Mon Ami Gabi)Women: Paris Romance (Only Available Here @ Mon Ami Gabi)Going beyond the great food and excellent service, my favorite part of my dining experience at Mon Ami Gabi is recieving the bill.  With an appetizer, entree, desert, and drink on my tab, I was surprised to find my final payment with a 20% tip to be only two digits.Great food, great service, great price.  What more could you ask for?Oh yeah that's right, the setting.  If you're seated indoors, you'll be dining under a very dimmly lit dinning hall with 50 foot ceilings.  Yes, it is that high and no I am not exaggerating.  If you're dinning outdoors (my favorite) you will not only be enjoying great food with a great wait staff but you will also be entertained every fifteen minutes by the fountains of Bellagio, directly across the street.Great food, great service, great price, great setting.What more could you ask for?"
437,"Made my return here to Mon Ami Gabi having dinner with fellow yelper Sharen G.  It was great as usual.  We had patio dining with a perfect table overlooking the Fountains of Bellagio.Sharen had the Beef Bourguignon, (I still can't pronounce it right) while I had the Ribeye & Frites.  She seemed to like her dish, it smelled really good.  My Ribeye was great especially when topped Béarnaise sauce.  Not bad for a $40 ribeye.Nice table, good service, great food.  Ok Mon Ami Gabi.  You've convinced me to upgrade you to 5 stars, only because Yelp doesn't give out .5 stars and I'm very generous."
438,"Good food, good service, great price, and great patio view of the Bellagio fountains.  I came here for breakfast and was tempted by pretty much everything on the menu, but I ended up with the egg white omelet and sampled my husband's strawberry and banana big skinny pancakes.  Both were excellent.  I also had a ginger peach hot tea that smelled lovely and was very flavorful.  Our server was very fast even though the place was packed, so I was pretty impressed.  When I'm in Vegas again, I'll probably be heading here for breakfast."
439,Have been here a number of times including last night which did not fail me. Everything was great. Slightly dissapointed we didn't get to sit outside but they sat us in the atrium by a window with a view of the water show.
440,"So I am walking through Paris Hotel and stumble upon a jewel... Mon Ami Gabi - the French Steakhouse.  Mon Ami Gabi is located within the Paris Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada.As a first time visitor, I had no expectations.  The service, cocktails, appetizers, entree and desert were all superb...  YES... I did say we ate a full course meal!!! LOLI can't remember the entire menu, but I started with a champagne + grey goose martini, followed by sauteed scallops (appetizer) and the most remarkable tilapia ever.  Who said you should not order seafood at a steakhouse?  I would usually agree, but not for Mon Ami Gabi.To top off the evening, my girlfriend ordered creme brulee with an additional spoon... I totally indulged.Don't miss this treat... Mon Ami Gabi is LP Certified...XoXo"
441,"This place is a must on a nice, sunny Vegas afternoon - patio seating right on LV Blvd! And the scallops sauteed in caramelized onion sauce is def. a MUST!! Sooo good!! Their seafood crepe, chic liver pate and sandwiches are good too, along with their real potato fries!"
442,"When the weather permits, meaning no rain, gusty winds, or over bearing dry desert heat, the patio is the spot to be. We had reservations for noon but because we wanted to sit on the patio, it took an extra 15 minutes or so for a table. I highly suggest waiting for it though. It's a perfect place to rock them loccs or douche bag sunglasses while people watching and enjoying the water show across the way at Bellagio.I had the French Toast ($11) which was topped with whipped cream and blueberries. Man was this entree' dank! The French Toast was made to perfection and the blueberries definitely complimented it. I may have to go out on a limb here and say it's one of the best French Toasts I have ever grubbed on.I also sampled the Jumbo Crab Cakes ($15) which I thought was very rich but still very well made. It's not an over whelming dish. Perhaps sharing it as an appetizer would be a good idea.I didn't sample my other table mate's dishes but I can say that everyone in my party had positive reviews. All of us agreed that everything we ordered was awesome. No complaints on that day.With all the many years I have been coming to Sin City, I can't believe I have barely experienced Mon Ami Gabi for the first time. I feel somewhat shameful. I've seriously been missing out on some great and affordable French food. I can't comment on their dinner yet but perhaps next time under them city lights. Au Revoir!"
443,"Its about time I get to eat here. I only waited two years!! And well...it was worth it. Every single time I go to Vegas I try to eat here, but I always sabotage it Vegas style by getting too drunk to make it in, too hungover, or passing it up to head to a pool party, who needs food in Vegas anyways, right? Nope, not this time. I woke up at 8am on a Saturday and rallied the girls together to get in here for a 10:30am reservation. Ended up making it there at 10am to put in a request for a table under the little Eiffel Tower. We were seated about 30minutes later at an outside table, yes finally. Absolutely worth the two year wait. I had a crepe made with chicken and Brie it was borderline amazing! I had a bite of all my friends breakfast as well and everything was so good! Nothing beats fresh squeezed oj. To top it off our waiter was great he was French and had a cute little accent so he played the whole part really well. I recommended Mon Ami Gabi to my parents when they got here two days later and they like it so much as well they ended up eating here twice while in Vegas. I highly recommend eating here, amazing food and great service, but definitely need a reservation to get in."
444,Absolutely amazing Ribeye! Worth every penny. Service was quick and preciseSeated immediatly with reservation.
445,"Mon Ami Gabi is my favorite stop in Vegas for breakfast/brunch. Sitting on the patio on a beautiful day with an order their delicious egg Florentine is simply wonderful. Another favorite of mine is the chicken, apple & Brie Crepe, it is so delicious!!  Fantastic food and stellar service, what more can you ask for in a restaurant? If you haven't been there yet then you better get going."
446,"Mon Ami Gabi in French means: My friend Gabi.And Gabi has become my friend indeed, a friend with benefits. Gabi enticed me when I was being driven down the strip and saw the hoards of tourists having a fling with him. Even though we hadn't met yet, the flames of jealousy were already being fanned. Gabi, stood at the bottom of the Eiffel tower replica...what a romantic Gabi is! He's a wanted man so if you want to hang with Gabi and avert your gaze at the Bellagio fountains...remember to call in advance to reserve your spot. The wait can be as long at 2 hours on some nights. Gabi will also let you dine inside, but the magic is lost without the blistering heat of Vegas and cooling views of the fountains. How does Gabi rank in his culinary skills? For French cuisine, Gabi is absolutely fantastic. His steak is pounded thin cooked to preference, his frites are unique, thin strips strings. They are addicting and keep you wanting more. His scallops are mediocre at best but simple if you just want something light. The accompanying cauliflower puree is a great substitute for mashed potatoes.Gabi, I count the days until our next encounter. You are the best friend with benefits I've ever had...you have stolen my stomach."
447,"I'll start off with the good things...First, I called ahead and made a reservation maybe 1 hour before we headed over. I had to call and push it back thanks to LV Blvd's crappy traffic and the people were very kind and changed it for us.  When we got there we circumvented a 1 hour wait thanks to the reservation and were seated promptly.We started off with a warm olive jar and some warm bread which was amazing in my opinion (but I'm a huge olive buff so I think I enjoyed it more than my wife).Now for the bad things...They screwed up my wife's drink order and MY drink (the Frangria) was a funky version of the classic sangria which ironically I love.  How they butchered it is beyond me.I ordered the 3 cheese plate with a side of garlic spinach since I saw some other guy recommend it on here.  Both...were...utter...crap.  The cheese plate was some $15 and included a tablespoon amount of Bluecheese, Brie, and some herb-laden cheese that I am unfamiliar with (oh btw, these are conclusions I've deduced, the waitress didn't bother to enlighten me to what the ""chef's choice"" actually was).  The spinach I had high hopes for and it failed me badly.  I personally love spinach, and i love garlic...but apparently the two together are a poor match.  It was barely edible w/out coupling it with bites of the steak that my poor wife offered me.Bill ran over $100 for a place that was allegedly a ""$$"" restaurant.  I hate to say it but I wouldn't recommend Mon Ami Gabi to the casual or the curious."
448,"Oh mon ami Gabi, c'est tres bon!This was a must do for me on my bday trip to Vegas. I made reservations over a month ago, just to make sure I got a tableau before the Memorial Day crowds overtook Vegas. Be aware that they do not take reservations for the outside patio and it is a separate waiting list. We waited less than 5 minutes for an outside table. The view of the Bellagio fountains and the people-watching on the Strip could not have been better. The Steak Classique was really delicious. I was surprised by how tender the steak was. The pommes frites were cooked to crispy perfection. Make sure you save room for dessert. I complained to my bf about how I hadn't had a good creme brulee all week. I need look no further; it was heaven. Creamy vanilla-y goodness that melted in my mouth. My bf ordered the profiteroles which were AMAZING."
449,"Excellent service, extensive selection of wines by the glass, good food (especially the sides) and if you're sitting by the window or outside you'll catch a great view of Bellagio's water show."
450,"This is pretty poor French food.  I had the onion soup which was honestly the worst I've ever had in my life.  I also tried to get them to make me a crepe complet (egg, ham, cheese) and they pretty much failed.  Sad."
451,"I wanted to like this restaurant, I really did and in all honestly it wasn't their fault.  Having sat on the patio in the direct sun which cooked us at a cool temp of 85 degrees we watched our butter slowly melt, our glasses of chardonnay boil, and out steak and fries turn grossly greasy.  Make dinner plans for after the sun goes down and so you can enjoy a romantic view of the Bellagio fountains and chat about the fashion sense of the people walking by.  PS.  Don't forget to order the french onion soup."
452,"Loved everything about dinner here. From the hot bread in the paper wrapper through the creme brulee, everything was excellent!We had a reservation that we were a little late for, and were still seated no problem. The by-the-glass wine list has a nice variety of choices, and I thought it was a nice touch that they had us try the wine the way they would if you bought a bottle.Three of us had the filet mignon with merlot butter and frites, and it was heaven on a plate. Perfectly cooked and dripping in that delicious butter, it was one of, if not the, best steak I've ever had. The frites that it comes with were a pleasant surprise. I was expecting something more like steak fries, which I'm not a HUGE fan of, and the crispy delicious little potato ribbons got even better when dragged through some of the extra merlot butter. For dessert we split creme brulee and bananas foster crepes. I don't eat bananas, but everyone else said they were super tasty, and the creme brulee was silky and not too sweet. Loved it.Service was friendly and efficient without being obtrusive. And for the quality of the service and food, and that the restaurant is right on the strip, it really wasn't that expensive. I'd highly recommend it!"
453,"For our Monday brunch I give Mon Ami Gabi 5 stars for their complimentary bread, 4 stars for ambiance and service, and 2 stars to the food. The location is obviously a great plus, with its view of the Bellagio fountain and people watching. Though the Vegas heat was at an oppressive 100+ degrees, the misters and umbrellas did a decent job keeping us from overheating. The bread is phenomenal. Our appetizers were great. But the dishes we paid the most for ended up being the most underwhelming. The appetizers that were a hit were the oysters, which were plump, fresh, and super refreshing, and the moules frites, though, I give more credit to the bread for that as it was the main vehicle in which we enjoyed the moules frites since the fries were just so-so. The seared tuna salad is definitely one to avoid. The seafood crepe had great scallops on the plate, but the shrimp tough and extremely overcooked. The best of the entrees was the open faced crab salad sandwich which was great for such a hot day, and unlike the seared tuna salad, seasoned well. I got sweetness from the crab, creaminess from the avocado, and bite from the thousand island dressing that boasted some really delicious chopped cornichons. $50 per person and we had drinks (iced tea and french 75s)."
454,"Came here based on Yelp reviews during a short weekend in Vegas.. and was not disappointed.Disclaimer- do not come here if you are looking for a long leisurely dinner.  We were in and out in 45 minutes having eaten bread, appetizers, and our main courses, and a whole carafe of frangria.  Service was great though, but it seemed as soon as we ordered our food and our waitress put it in the computer, it was on our tables!  Started with the Petite Salad- Olive vinagrette had great flavor and just enough olive to be good, without being overbearing.  Friend had the Onion Soup- he loved it so much he did not share!  The soup was more the size of a super tall crock with cheese dripping down the sides, just crisp enough (the best part!)Main course- Steak Classique.  Huge piece of steak, and lots of butter flavor.  I was worried the steak may be lower quality based on the price, but it was actually very good, not tough, and easy to eat!   Friend had the Au Poivre, and liked his flavor, though he had a bit more fat on his steak than me (lucky me!)Definitly get the Frangria (it is just like Sangria)!  It was cheapish for Vegas, and a hugh carafe of yummy wine mixed with fresh fruits.Mon Ami Gabi is a good LV stand by- nice steak meal without paying an arm and a leg.  One point of advice- maybe order your appetizer and wait to order your main course if you do not want the meal to fly by too fast!"
455,"Very quick, good food, good wines, and your final bill will be much lower than other restaurants right on the StripThe outdoor patio is all the rage but you will probably have to wait for a whileIndoor seating is very nice and not too noisy"
456,"Of my top 5 favorite restaurants in as Vegas, Mon Ami Gabi is my go-to place for all things visitor, birthday, or steak and fries related. If I don't make it to this great place at least 3 times a year, something is seriously wrong. Let me summarize the main reasons why this eatery should be on your list of places to try while in Vegas (and if you live here, why it should be in your top 5)The food, service, and decor are a much higher standard than the price point. Sure- you can get impeccable 3 course meal, 5 star service , and white table cloth upscale dining elsewhere, but can you think of a place where you can get all three for less than $50 a person? I know of only two other places in Vegas that give you this level of value, and they only do it for lunch and one is hit or miss on the quality.  The steaks. As a foodie and self proclaimed grill god, I make my own at home, with only one exception- Mon Ami Gabi. It 's the sauces and fries that keep me coming back. Everyone loves the atmosphere! If your entertaining a visitor, or celebrating something with a fellow local, there is a special quality about this restaurant  that everyone loves. I have yet to meet anyone that doesn't rave about MAG. ."
457,"Where else in Las Vegas can you sit outside and feel the AC while the people on the street are walking in 115 degree weather. Started out greeted by a great waitress. I forgot her name but she was very kind the whole time. Water was always refilled, she was very personable and went above and beyond just asking us how our day was. She actually wanted to get to know us! We had the quiche lorraine. OMG! This was one of the best quiches I have ever had! It wasn't a slice but it was the whole pie! It was very good sized and the crust was so flaky. The egg wasn't overpowering and had great flavor. The good thing I like about this was that the bacon was thick cut! *drools* Around $12.00The crab salad was allright. It was served open faced or with one piece of bread. It tasted fresh but wasn't anything super duper special. Real crab thou. Around $14.00The bread they give you in the beginning is really cute. It comes wrapped in Mon Ami Gabi paper and is a delicious fresh baked french baguette. Great view of the Bellagio and you can people watch! Around $30 for 2 people for lunch not too bad at all."
458,"Were I able I would rate Mon Ami Gabi at 0. We attempted to dine here on our last day in Vegas, but were intercepted by the rudest hostess I had the displeasure of dealing with.My Beau wanted to have a nice lunch with me before we left, and specifically selected Mon Ami Gabi for it's view of the Bellagio Fountains. We approached the hostess stand, and asked to be seated at a table for two on the patio. It was 3:45, yet the hostess grabbed two dinner menu's. When we inquired as to when they stopped serving lunch, we were told that dinner began at 4. The hostess, a napoleon complexed girl who was evidently severely jaded about her job, proceeded to lead us outside past a dozen empty tables to one far out of the way around the side... with a view of the facade of the building. Perfect. We asked if we could be seated at a table nearer the front of the patio, as we had wanted to catch the Bellagio Fountains before we left. She scowled, looked around, and said that was all she had. A basic 'screw you all, I will seat you where I want'. Again, we politely pointed out that there were many empty tables scattered throughout the patio, many of which were in the desirable location of the front. Nope. She was having none of it, and basically said that the table she was offering us near the emergency exit in the very far end/back of the patio was the only place we were welcome to dine. Enough of that, we decided at that point that dining there was not worth any amount of 'service' she or the waitstaff could provide. We left, without so much as sitting down. So perhaps the food at Mon Ami Gabi is decent, or even great... However due to a profusely incompetent hostess I did not have the opportunity to give this restaurant a chance."
459,We ate here for my wifes birthday.  The hanger steak is pretty good but the steak bernaise was out of this world.  Steaks come with little shreds of potato that taste exactly like lays potato chips.  The service was pretty good and we had a nice view of the water show across the street.  I would eat there again.
460,"Someone recommended Mon Ami Gabi for dinner during my 24 hour trip to Vegas, and to be honest, I was a bit skeptical of going to a chain (especially one a couple metro stops away from my home) during my glamorous vacay. Still, after narrowing down what we wanted to eat, here we ended up. Service was fine, though I almost felt bad leaving the tip for the waiter when I felt like we saw the bus boy more. We were seated quickly (Tuesday night), and there was a 45 minute wait for the patio. Though it was one of the reasons I got the recommendation, we were way too hungry to wait (and we only had 24 hours in Vegas people!!), but lucky to get a table right away just inside the patio. Food was good, and the portions were very generous. We were brought bread with butter and a little dish of carrot slaw--deeee-licious! We both ordered the soup du jour which was a potato leek vichyssoise, also outstanding. I was a little surprised at the cut of my steak (I was expecting more of a sirloin type piece, but got what looked like hangar or skirt), but it was cooked well and the au poivre sauce was flavorful. The frites were very thin and crispy to the point of not really tasting like potatoes anymore.Back to the aforementioned patio: Mon Ami Gabi is located in the Paris Casino, directly across the strip from the Bellagio fountains, which makes it's patio so popular. Since we had a window seat, though we couldn't hear the music, we could still see the fountains which made the dining experience very memorable. If you can't wait for the patio, definitely ask for a table inside it."
461,"Amazing food, great view, nice variety of choices (both in price & food).  Outdoor patio is cooled by misters and covered with patio umbrellas, but smoking is permitted.  If you want to enjoy natural sunlight and get a peek outside, ask to sit in the atrium by a window.  Lunch options include $9 -$18 salads, $12-$15 sandwiches, $12-$14 (and a prime $18) burgers, $18-$23 entrees ($32 for filet mignon).  We ordered the seared salmon entree and the full Mussels Marinière appetizer (which came with their amazing fries and was enough for a meal).  I'm not a big fan of mussels, but these were amazing.  I've posted a photo of the salmon, which was served with orzo pasta mixed with asparagus and peas.  The only thing I would have changed is to substitute edamame for the peas, but it was still fantastic as served."
462,"The food is not very good. I ordered the sauteed sole and it was so bland and tasteless. It was something that I could have done a better job at and I don't really consider myself a cook. My husband  had the filet mignon and thought it tasted like it had been previously frozen. The service was a little slow but friendly. The atmosphere was very nice. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience especially considering how expensive it was."
463,Good food. We had cold yellow and red beet soup. It was ok. The beets needed to be cooked before purring it had really uncomfortable taste if raw beets. I had scallops - Off the wall good and my husband had steak frittatas. Amazingly melting in you mouth. Just like cotton candy. Loved it
464,"I go to Mon Ami Gabi every year when I am in Vegas for work.  I usually stay at the Paris, so it is convenient.  Plus, the views from the patio is of the Bellagio water show every 20 minutes or so.We started with our usual Escargot appetizer and it is great paired with the french bread at your table.  Buttery pesto garlic deliciousness.I am simple at M.A.G.  I've been so many times, I've honed in on one item - the Filet Mignon with Merlot Butter.  The meat is so soft, you swear you can cut it with a fork.  And the flavors are off the charts.I was too full to attempt dessert.  But I've had it before and it does not fail.I'm a big fan of Mon Ami Gabi.  It is a great place for a fancy dinner, or a dinner meeting, or just to eat and people watch the freaks in Vegas make their way down the strip."
465,"very good lunch place, great service, reasonably priced.oysters du jour - pretty freshbaked mac & cheese - delicious, cheesy crispy top, hot gooey saucesteak frites - my least favorite dish, the steak was very dryseared salmon w/orzo - VERY, VERY good.  cooked just enough to perfection.the total came out to be about $90 with tax & 20% tip included."
466,"My wife and I were in Vegas for our honeymoon and stayed at Bellagio.  We had dinner at Mon Ami on a whim our second night and it was fantastic!The baked cheese appetizer is a must-have, and we really liked the steak frites.  I had the one with Bearnaise sauce and loved it, my wife had the blue cheese and it was great too.We didn't think breakfast was as good as dinner - the food was good but spendy.  Still, compared to restaurants in the vicinity it was still a value.  It seems like everything's expensive near Bellagio.It's not cheap - for dinner we had a carafe of their Frangria (think sangria), the baked cheese appetizer, and two steaks.  We were out the door with a good tip for just over $100.  Enjoy!"
467,"Made reservation through opentable & came here for lunch last Friday. Staff were very attentive. Our server made sure we didn't pour our carafe of Frangria (reallliee good) ourselves :D  Great view, service, price, & food!!!On to the foodies we had:*Mussels Marinière* --  Absolutely deee-lishcious!!!  Best mussels dish I've yet had in Vegas. To savor it all (down to the last few drips of sauce) we dipped the remaining of our fresh baguette into their white wine & herb sauce. Yuumm!! *Seafood Crepe* -- Excellent dish! Nice sized scallops & shrimps - perfectly cooked. Best eaten when served fresh out from the kitchen.*Grilled Salmon & Spinach Salad* -- The blueberries & walnuts went so well with this salad! Big portion salmon - flavorful, not dry & grilled just right on a semi warm bed of spinich.HELLSYA i'll be returning to dine at this place again... well the next time i'm out here for Vegas~!  ^^;"
468,"Having done Vegas (at least once) every year for the past few years, it's nice to finally find a restaurant that is not overpriced, doesn't make you feel super-touristy (even while you're eating right on the strip), and has decent food.  Based on the food, I would give it more like a 3.5 stars but I'm going to round it up for pricing and service.First of all, I have to say the service was wonderful - never rushed and the food coming in at perfect intervals.  By some stroke of bon fortuna, my sister and I were seated immediately on the patio even though it was a Saturday night and the restaurant was already packed to the max with diners.  Once seated, we were served our waters almost immediately and given our very own small baguette.  The baguette was good, but the complimentary creamy carrot-based dipping sauce it came with was perfection!  I hope they put that on their regular menu because I would pay for that.Our waiter took our orders pretty promptly which gave us enough time to sit and relax and watch the Bellagio fountain show before our app showed up.  We had the escargot to start off with.  They serve you 6 of these bad boys, already de-shelled and therefore not so intimidating for first-timers like us.  They were absolutely delicious - covered in enough butter and garlic and herbs to make you forget you were eating a snail.  Their fish is supposed to be fresh everyday which is always a plus for this Californian.  So for our main course, I ordered the skate and my sister had the trout.  The skate was too salty, but had a decent amount of butter to keep it edible.  Skate is pretty tasty on its own so I wasn't sure why they had to drench that thing with so much salt.  The fancy garlic potato chips and mixed veggie accompaniment were very good however.  My sister's trout was exactly what I expected it to taste like - which is to say it tasted more like trout with butter and lemon and less like a salty hot mess like mine did.  The total bill came out to, what?  $55?  Wow, you can eat good food for a good price on the strip!  Overall, the food had some highs and lows but the service along with the beautiful views were enough to make for the beginning of a good night in Vegas."
469,"Flew in here for bites on a yelp lead: did not disappoint! Vegas either has high end or low rent, there is no real decent culinary middle of the road in these parts high roller. However Mon Ami is not a gamble and delivers on minimum chips ;)"
470,"The place was excellent just like I expected it to be. We didn't get patio seating unfortunately, so I will use that as my excuse next time to come here again! But then, this place really needs no excuse for me to dine...The staff here are super friendly and courteous, and very efficient. Our waitress was easy to chat with, very knowledgeable about the menu, and answered even our silly questions about the humongous wine bottles decorating the restaurant. She was very on top of everything, checking periodically to make sure everything was to our liking while my friends and I dined.Between all 4 of us, we ordered the BLT sandwich, seafood crepe, chicken crepe, and the sandwich of the day - lamb burger stuffed with roquefort cheese. The 2 sandwiches came with waffle fries and regular fries respectively. However, their fries are very different, as they are cut super super thin, so it's like eating potato chips instead of french fries. I loved this, but my friend was not quite as fond of it. We all liked our main dish though, so that was alright =). My lamb burger was juicy and oh-so-delish. The roquefort was just such yummy goodness and a perfect complement to the lamb, which was cook to a perfect medium-rare just as I requested. I can't tell you how happy that makes me when a restaurant can fulfill such a simple request such as this. You would think the request is simple but you will be amazed how many places always get it wrong.The ambiance is very relaxing and chic, posh without being pretentious. It was a lovely experience and I can't wait to go back again!"
471,"Great environment. Great Food. Great Service! My gf and I were running late so we extended our reservation and gladly they were able to do so. In the end, we were still very late (we had to walk from aria to take the tram from city center to get bellagio then walk over to paris).  For a sec, I thought we would have to wait in line for our table and then we would have to run to MGM to catch our show @ 930. But turns out, our table was still there and it was a pretty good spot (right next to the window). So we didn't have to sit outside and deal with heat, but at the same time we were able to see the fountains at Bellagio. Food wise. We decided to go with seafood because we had enough of buffets and steaks. We ordered 3 dishes: Mussels Mariniere (white wine and herbs), Escargots, Seared Sea Scallops. I must admit I was really impressed with the Scallops and Mussels. Scallops and Mussles were really fresh and tender. Due to bad experiences with escargots, i have not had it for years until I came to Mon Ami Gabi. And lets just say the escargot was not too bad. Also, i believe the mussels came with fries, which tasted like chips. Not bad. Dinner was served quickly. Service was great. We didn't need to rush for the show. We had more than enough time. We ended up having time to walk from Paris to MGM. Overall, this was a fantastic experience. My gf and I will be back on our next trip to Vegas.....Mon Ami Gabi."
472,"I don't mean to be harsh, but I'll never eat there again. Sirloin should not be prepared that way, it was flat and tough. I've never had a sirloin that was as tough as that. I got the steak classic, sauce was good, but couldn't deliver the steak. I hear the view is nice on the patio but we ate inside to escape the heat so I had to leave my rating at two stars. FYI, total came out to $31 for 9 ounces of ""Sirloin""."
473,"I was out and about this past weekend, photowalking with a friend down The Strip with the Paris being our first stop.  It was roughly 4:00pm or so when our stomachs began to speak to us.  A quiet stomach is usually a happy one, and mine was getting ready to tell me off for not feeding it.  My friend said that steak frites makes for a good dish; me being fairly unexposed to French Cuisine, I learn that it's a common dish consisting of a steak and fries.  I like steak, and I love potatoes, so this sounded like a winning combination to me.  We wandered through the Paris and looked at the menus of the different restaurants and cafes; surprisingly, the price for steak frites appeared to be cheapest at Mon Ami Gabi!  The other cafes offered steak frites for about $3 to $4 more than Mon Ami Gabi's offering.So after deciding, my friend and I enter Mon Ami and are seated quickly, indoors just as we asked.  Water was brought to our table, and we were asked if we knew what we wanted.  It's hard to know what I want when we've been seated for less than two minutes...but okay.  We ask for a few more minutes, and the waitress then explains the day's specials.  My friend and I haven't even ordered yet and we both get the feeling that our server is either having a bad day, or doesn't want to work there.  The next time she comes by, we order the Steak Bearnaise ($23.95), a steak frites dish serve with bearnaise sauce.  While waiting for our dish we enjoy ourselves some french bread and butter.When the food came, the dish was exactly what my friend had explained: steak and fries!  The steak was a thin strip of meat that we had cooked medium.  Fries were thin, crispy, and barely salted.  It made for a very pleasing side to the steak.  The bearnaise sauce was thick enough to coat either the steak or fries when dipped, but thin enough to start dripping off your food if you didn't eat it right away.  A nice buttery consistency and flavor, with hints of white wine possibly.  The food was good; something I'd travel back to the Paris for?  Not really.  My rating above is a reflection of the service my friend and I experienced.  We were visited by our server a total of four times during our meal: to bring us water, to take our order, to take our dishes away and to drop off the check.  No asking how the food was, refills on our water, not even stopping by to see how things were after making eye contact with the server.  We didn't feel welcomed, we felt like a burden to the server.  This didn't feel like a French restaurant on the strip, this felt like a bad night at Applebees.  And that's not a hit to Applebees; I'm satisfied with the service at Applebees."
474,"This review is long overdue! I have been eating here for years, it is always on my ""must have"" list when visiting vegas. I have NEVER been disappointed with the food or service in the many years I have eaten here. I love everything on the menu. EVERYTHING. Honestly you cant go wrong. The french onion soup, the bread, the steaks, the seafood, dessert - it is all fabulous. Thank you mon ami for being my favorite vegas restaurant!"
475,"Last time i went to vegas with a group of gf's they kept talking about these burgers at ""that one restaurant in Paris"" so finally after alot of talk we went to go try it out.  The burgers were quite yum...not your average burgers ut speciatly stuff with special cheeses and what not.  the burgers were yum and they come with a bucket of yummy fries BUT i still think the counter is better!"
476,"We sat in the sweet spot of the dining room closest to the street: at one of the tables just inside the open french windows, sheltered from the midday heat but with a nice view of the Bellagio fountains across the street.The design is French brasserie all the way; the service is cheerful American. This may be the perfect combination.Let's pause for a moment and offer thanks for the baguette. It's placed on your table in a paper bag. So chic. But the taste: the shattering crunch of the exterior, the fresh and chewy interior, the joy of its union with the rapidly melting, slightly salted butter . . . You could just eat the whole thing yourself, or you could order lunch. Both are good choices.We shared the butter lettuce salad, which allegedly included asparagus (didn't see many; maybe husband stole them while I was having an affair with the bread) and a huge round of goat cheese. Briefly considered slathering the rest of the baguette with same, wolfing down the whole thing, and returning to the room for a nap. No! Discipline!Ahi tuna burger was moist and delicious. Lots of wines by the glass; the riesling was refreshing.But whatever. I primly rolled up the top of the baguette bag and popped it in my purse. Nana would have been proud."
477,"RIP-OFF ALERT: There is an automatic 18% gratuity for parties of 5 (!!!!) or more. And that includes breakfast!Other than that, the place is fine. I just cannot stand this sort of cheats anymore."
478,"The food was well priced for what we got.  I think the service was above average but not stellar, probably what kept me from giving it 5 stars."
479,"This place was great!  The food was superb, the staff was really on point even to the point of cleaning up the crumbs that were on our table.  The food was delicious and not extremely overpriced (esp for Vegas).  We managed to get some patte and corned beef on the cusp of breakfast/lunch.  Our waiter managed to sneak us in.  However, the greatest perk of this restaurant is that it is right in front of the Belagio.  The fountain wasn't working when I was there, but I can imagine it going off while you're eating your meal."
480,"A friend had recommended this place for lunch. I was hoping that my friend & I could get in without making reservations. It looked packed.Since it was just 2 of us, we were able to get a table outside with no problem. I don't know if that happens all the time. But it worked out for me. I tried one of the day's specials. It was a cod sandwich with aioli sauce. The sandwich was great. But it was the aioli sauce that put it over the top."
481,"This is one of the most amazing French food experiences I have ever had. It definitely bought me into a little nostalgia of being in France. I wish i knew our server's name, but he was number 13 and was an excellent waiter. He was constantly checking on us and making sure everything was okay, he also have really nice blue eyes and was very charming. :D He hooked my friends and I up with the breakfast menu since it was near the end of breakfast/beginning of lunch. We were given fresh baguettes and they were still warm with butter! :) YUM! I ordered the country style pâté ($9.95) for an appetizer, which was pretty damn good. :)My friends ordered the Three Eggs and Corned Beef Hash & Poached Eggs. It looked really damn good and they were very good portions especially since it was about $9.95-10.95. I got the Steak Frites with Red Wine sauce. The FLAVOR WAS AMAZING and the Steak was perfectly cooked to the way I wanted it. Truly a symphony of flavor for sure. The next time I go to Vegas, I am definitely stopping by Mon Ami Gabi first, it would be the perfect way to start vegas for anyone that loves good food and French cuisine! Bon appetit!Je reviendrai ici la prochaine fois! :D"
482,"""I can't believe I drank that much...if I see another Captain 'n Coke I'm going to puke."" ""I'm never drinking again.""  Sound familiar?  Well, that's what we were telling ourselves when we were looking around for a place to grab brunch.  I remember coming across Mon Ami Gabi when I looked at Yelp reviews, so my coworker and I decided to check out the menu and look inside.  As we walked into the main part of the restaurant, we were blown away by a HUGE bloody mary bar.  Both of us looked at each other with our mouths hanging open.  I'm not sure if it was because I was still drunk...but the bloody mary bar had a glowing aura around it.   It was a sign.  We were meant to drink more here.  I'm still convinced that bloody marys are a panacea for hangovers.  Trust me, try it out next time.Anyway, after we finished staring at the bloody mary bar for 5 minutes, we walked to the back of the restaurant and we fell in love.  There was a beautiful outdoor seating area and the rest of the restaurant had sunlight streaming in.  The food was great.  My coworker and I ordered two soups.  I've attached pictures for your reference. ;)  I got a porcini mushroom soup and it was DELICIOUS.  One of the best soups I've ever had.  For lunch, my coworker ordered the salad with grilled salmon and I had the croque madame.  The grilled salmon salad was very tasty.  My croque madame was very good, but I found the bread to be a bit too buttery and crunchy to my liking.  Can you believe it?  I actually said something was TOO buttery.  Butter and bacon...can't live without it. I will definitely be back for the good food, impeccable service, beautiful atmosphere, and of course, bloody mary heaven.  ;)"
483,"I loved the restaurant. I came in and it was gorgeous. I asked for a seat on the enclosed patio. I was reminded of a greenhouse. I was served a whole baguette with butter, which I tasted but couldn't eat all by myself.I ordered an open-faced crab salad sandwich. The toast wasn't too great, but the crab salad was delicious. They had some sort of sauce on the side too that was great with the bread and with the little waffle potato chip side.It was $14.95 for lunch. Not bad for providing me with a Paris ambiance. As I dined, I felt like I was in France. Never been but that's how I imagine it."
484,"This is THE place.  Order the sirloin, I like it with the butter. Everyone at our table LOVED their food.  Fries are sick. I licked my plate, my fingers and my steak knife. Eat here."
485,The best breakfast I have ever had. Amazing french toast.  Large slices of bread that are crispy on the outside and doughy-rich on the inside. Covered with like two cups of just-softened blueberries and a large dollop of freshly whipped cream. Pour the warm blueberry syrup over it all. Heaven.  Attentive service. Seemed like they refilled our coffee every 90 seconds.  Cute atmosphere -- the atrium is light and airy. It seems like a French bistro on Las Vegas steroids.
486,"This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to on the strip. Fantastic to sit on the patio on a nice day/night.Being a vegetarian I am always limited to sides and salads on the strip. This place offers great sides and they also do a vegetarian platter which is a huge sampling plate of veggies. (whipped cauliflower very good!)During lunch, they do a good veggie burger.My favorite thing right now at this place is the warm brie cheese with honey and pepper and Frangria (French Sangria) - so good.Can be very romantic as you are right across the Bellagio fountain show and under the Eiffel tower. Great atmosphere!"
487,"Solid goodness, but not great. With some really fabulous buffets, it's almost unfair to compare a restaurant based on just one dish-- but this place has good food without gouging you price wise. Our table had the warm olive jar, warm Brie cheese with honey and escargot for appetizers, and these were all good but not great ( escargot was best). I had the steak Roquefort, and it was decent, for the price I was satisfied and didn't feel abused, but I'd rather go to a buffet. Atmosphere was nice, but not incredibly impressive either- it's hard to take a place seriously as an upscale location when you see guys roll in with suggestive tshirts on."
488,"I have always walked by Mon Ami GABI and always wanted to eat there. It has a great view of the Bellagio Fountains. This place has great food and service. 15 of my closest friends enjoyed a nice dinner here on a hot July day. The server was great. He was on top of everything. My friends and I shared our meals. We had the Lemon-Thyme Seared Salmon, Prime Rib, Oysters du jour, Roast Chicken & Frites, Steak Bearnasie and Seared Sea Scallops. The food was excellent. I would come back just to eat the Oysters, it was so good! It also didnt hurt that I was with people I love most in my life."
489,"Hands down, one of the best meals of life (...and I've had a lot of damn good meals)....We made a reservation at Mon Ami Gabi for dinner on the 4th of July. We sat inside and were waited on my Michelle, who was outstanding. When we got to the table they brought us an amuse bouche of orzo salad (yum) and their french bread...warm, crusty, oh-so-satisfying.We started our meal with a few drinks and also ordered the baked cheese. So, so good....I am craving it right now. It's basically a mixture of soft cheeses (cream cheese, goat cheese, etc.) that are baked in the oven, mixed with fresh marinara sauce, and served with toasted french bread drizzled in basil garlic oil. There were only two of us and we basically licked the bowl clean...it was that good.For our meals we both got the signature filet mignon with merlot butter and red wine reduction. I got the asparagus for my side and my friend got the fries. The portions were surprisingly large and the meat was impeccably cooked. The filet was soft and well seasoned....melted in my mouth. Without a doubt, the best steak I have ever had (and funnily enough also one of the cheapest). The asparagus was fresh and delicious. I also stole quite a few fries from across the table...those things are addictive. We ended the meal with creme brulee. The custard was sweet and creamy and rich....exactly what I wanted. Overall, a fantastic meal. I couldn't pick out a single flaw (and I can almost always pinpoint more than one). During our meal I looked around the nearby tables and picked up on a few conversations, and everyone was commenting on how spectacular the food and service were...lots of happy people and bellies. I will come here time and time again. Wonderful meal, wonderful waitress, and a price that honestly can't be beat. My new ""to go to"" place in Vegas."
490,"Another trip to Vegas mean another stop at Mon Ami Gabi. I just can't get enough of this place. The food was just as good as before, but the service was ehh this time around. I missed the waitress from before. Our waiter this time around was here and there but no connection. As always, we had the French onion soup, a small salad, and the liver platter. The French onion soup was just how I remember it to be. Hot and gooey from the melted cheese and warming with caramelized onions and the broth. The starter salad was just mixed greens with a light vinaigrette. Simple yet tasty. The liver platter was a first and it did not disappoint. You get a generous slice of liver mousse pate. It comes with sliced crusty French baguette and pickled mini onions and gherkins. It doesn't taste like liver pate at all. It's very soft and creamy in texture. For our group's entrees, we had the mussels that was steamed in white wine, burger du jour: open face duck burger stuffed with cheese, open faced ham and cheese sandwich, chicken and apple crepe, the ever so classic quiche Lorraine, and scallops. The mussels was fresh and delicious. It was great with the baguettes to soak up all the sauce. The burger du jour was not up to par as before. It was really gamey and needed something to counter balance that taste. But it was good nonetheless, if you like gamey duck. The opened faced ham and cheese was just good. You get a lot of the gooey cheese if you love cheese. It had a comfort food feeling attached to it. The scallops was not as big as the previous visit and it seemed a little bit overcooked this time around. The apple crepe was gigantic. It's a mix of savory and sweet. The chicken the the sliced granny smith apples goes really well together along with the white Alfredo sauce. It's definitely bigger than the normal crepes you can get at the crepe stand inside Paris. The classic quiche Lorraine was just like the previous time, wonderfully eggy. Everything was just soo yummy. I think we came in with high expectations from last time so we were a little bummed. It's still nice to see the water show from Bellagio across the street every 15 minutes tho!  See you in a few months..."
491,"On our trip to Vegas my bf and I were looking for a place to have lunch and we were walking around Paris' casino floor and starving so we decided to check out the menu outside Mon Ami Gabi. I was sold on their lunch selection so we proceeded to get a table on the patio.  The hostess may have lacked some common sense because she seated us at the table that was away from the fans that sprayed cool mists, umbrellas, and in direct sunlight in 105 degrees of heat. wth!? After burning our elbows on the scorching hot tables, the servers brought out iced cold water which melted within a few seconds due to where we were seated. My bf asked for a table change closer to where everyone else was being seated (under umbrellas and fans). Our server was really sweet and moved us to a table towards the side of the patio and it felt nice to have that section to ourselves.  Anyway we started off with the yogurt gazpacho that was part of their daily specials menu and it was so refreshing and tart for a hot day. the soup was served extremely chilled so it was perfect. For lunch, we got the steak sandwich with caramelized onions and a chicken blt sandwich. the steak sandwich and the fresh potato chips were definitely on point. As for the chicken sandwich, it was an ordinary chicken sandwich but the portion was pretty good.  Service was great here as well; our drinks were constantly refilled before they ever reached the half way point. The patio is definitely fun  to sit in to people watch and enjoy the view of the Bellagio fountain across the street."
492,We went here for Sunday brunch around noon. We got to sit down in the patio which was nice and cool and we had the spectacular bellagio water show view to enjoy. The mimosas were delicious and the French baguette hit the spot. Would love to eat here again.
493,Another very good meal at Mon Ami Gabi at the Paris Hotel-- thank you to my waiter Chris for his recommendations.  Had the filet mignon with a combination of the blue cheese and peppercorn sauce -- Delicious!!  Started with the market tomato salad -- nicely presented and very fresh. For dessert -- a bowl of fresh berries with chocolate sauce!! Just as good this morning as it was last night (It was a really big bowl)
494,"So, here's the scene. My friends and I are wicked hung over. It's the sort of hang over where you really need to purge a couple more times before you'll feel okay. Stupidly, we decide to eat here. We stumble through ordering before realizing the magnitude of our mistake. The view of the Bellagio fountains is great and the smell of the food wafting from other tables is probably great, when you aren't hung over. However, being hung over, this place was not good. I ordered some crepe-ish thing which came with a cloyingly heavy cream sauce. My stomach just couldn't take it. Those who know me know how much I can put away, but I just didn't have the stomach to get anywhere with these crepes. None of my friends were able to find hangover friendly fare either.*******Please note, I have eaten here when not hung over. It's a fairly solid restaurant, but only slightly better than Mimi's Cafe. I believe the primary value of this restaurant lies in the view and the location. There is much better French food for much less back home in SF."
495,"This place is a must go if you are dining in Las Vegas.Amazing steaks, amazing service.  I love their bread. If you get the mussels, dip the bread in the sauce.  It is so so good!!!Time your dinner around sunset.  Watch the Bellagio water show while you eat.  It is am amazing dining experience.  Trust me!."
496,"On our last full day in Vegas, my date and I had breakfast here.  We sat outside - thankfully out of the sun! - and each had the blueberry cinnamon toast.  VERY GOOD!  Thick cuts of bread with plenty of blueberry sauce and blueberries, topped with a huge dollop of whipped cream!  The only negative was my date had a little delay trying to get a black napkin as she was wearing a black skirt that morning.  If I am in Vegas again, I would definitely consider Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast again!"
497,"Forking over a hundred bucks cash for a dinner is NOT an easy proposition for me.  And to be perfectly honest, I wasn't entirely thrilled at the selection of this restaurant in particular.  I felt that if we were going to be dropping that kind of dough, we should have gone for one of the funkier restaurants that Vegas offers.But the group had spoken, and who am I to cause trouble.  (Acquiesce is my middle name.  Yeah... not the coolest middle name out there.  But it's better than Francis.)So to say that my expectations were low, and my grumpy levels were high would not be a misrepresentations.  Of course, the fact that I was having a great time with an awesome group of people did wonders for my overall levels of grumpitude.But all of that was blown away once the food arrived.  The crab cakes were awesome, and the fillet minion may very well rank at the top of the list of finest pieces of meat I have ever put in my mouth.  (Shut up.)Seriously.  It was an astonishingly delicious steak.  Astonishingly astonishing.  At that point, I was wondering if we were going to underpay with the hundreds.The place itself is nice.  Standard high end french bistro decor, with a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.  I was bummed that I was facing away from them - but really forgot all about it the second I cut into my steak.  Perfect food.  Yes please."
498,"I still can't pronounce the name of this place.Located in Paris hotel casino, this place is right near the entrance facing Las Vegas blvd.A friend decided on this place because of the yelp ratings.We came in with about 15-20 people around 4:30PM on a hot Saturday afternoon in the middle of July.We were seated right away, service was great!Glass was never empty and the servers were always around.However, the food took a while, but this was a big group.The fresh baguette was delicious!! Comes out hot and fresh =) yummm unlimited and free! Goes great with the butter and carrot thing.Had a glass of sangria which was refreshing and yummy =) my friend bought a pitcher and the waiter was nice enough to offer to put more ice in it.The menu had quite a few variety: seafood, steak, salad, and hamburgers. Price was decent for a nice restaurant. I would say everything was about $10-$30 a plate.The oysters ($15) was so delicious! Very fresh and they had a great vinegar sauce to go along with the horseradish. Yummy!!I ordered the prime medium well hamburger ($13) with grilled cheese, which came with a side of their frites. Hamburger was good. I loved the little pickles that came with it. The frite was yummy too, thin crispy french fries.I had a bite of the scallops and it was amazing!! I loved it!Overall I enjoyed our early dinner. I was super stuffed! I would come back again for the oysters and scallops!"
499,"I have no idea how to pronounce the name or what it means, but I'm a fan!  I was in Vegas a few months ago, and was very impressed by the ambiance, cleanliness, food quality and overall service.  We waited at the bar; I was on my kick of Maker's on the rocks with fresh ginger and lime and the bartender totally accommodated my request.  When we moved to the bar to patio seating, the bus boy carried our drinks, and  my ladle of ginger for later!We sat outside, and our server was kinda a smart ass, which was oddly fun.  We got a variety of dishes; pate, muscles and hanger steak.  Everything was delicious; well seasoned and cooked well.  I think we got dessert, but the night got a little foggy after all that Maker's.On top of all that, the heat lamps, view of the street and the Belaggio fountains and music going off all night set the mood perfectly."
500,"Great French restaurant at Paris. Excellent food and service. Make a reservation as the wait was 45-60 mins when we arrived, thankfully we had reserved on Open Table and walked right in. Ordered the peppercorn steak, it was good. My girlfriend had the roasted chicken, that was also good. It's not  THE BEST French food but the price is great. We had a shrimp cocktail appetizer, two entres, all for under $70, that's a decent deal.."
501,"great french bistrowhat i ate:- baguette: i usually dont mention the bread, but this bread was pretty amazing! came out warm with lovely butter and some type of corn orzo salad- sea scallops gratinee: very flavorful, but decided this was not the best way to eat scallops. the flavor of the scallops was covered by the sauce. although the sauce was amazing. i soaked up every bit with baguette- steak au poivre: i was expecting a much more peppery and flavorful sauce. i ordered the steak rare, so that it was very tender. of course, amazing fries- skate: delicate and flavorful. the bite i had was delicoius- seared sea scallops: i should have ordered this as my app instead of the gratinee. perfectly cookedpros:- reservations: they were so gracious and accommodating. we changed the reservation about five times before we got there, and then ended up needed to move to another table to fit in one more person. despite all the changes they were very willing to work with us- food: excellent french bistro food. everything i had was cooked well- service: attentive. constantly filling our wine glasses and water glassescons:- outside bathroom: i guess this is just one of those vegas hotel restaurant things, but restrooms are always located outside. kind of a drag to have to walk a bit to get to the ladies room, especially if youre seated way inside the restaurant- price: definitely not cheap, but honestly, not that expensive either. it really depends on what you splurge on - if you get an app, if you get wine, it all adds up.... i got an app, an entree, and had two bottles (share them with three others) and got away with paying $70 - tax+tip includedwould i go again? ... im not sure. while dinner was great, it wasnt crazy amazing. there are just so many other restaurants in vegas that i want to try. despite my caution about going again, i am still very glad i had dinner here."
502,"Delicious! This place is good. I had the bacon & poached egg frisee salad and it is awesome but the star of the meal is the steak frite. I had the steak bernaise and it was perfectly cooked, huge portion and $23. I have eaten here a few times and it is consistently good. My sister took a few bites of my food and told me it's the best steak frite she ever had. I don't know if I would go that far but it's damn good. Service is friendly and fast. There are a ton of great restaurants in Vegas to try but when your looking for good quality at a reasonable price it's worth going here."
503,"Last minute reservations to handle our party of 8? no problem! They were able to sit us within an hour of calling them ahead of time. Steak Bordelaise. Carmelized onions on steak, served with ""frites"". This was cooked perfectly and was a fairly large portion. My stomach was sufficiently full at the end of the meal. My main gripe with this place was our server. She probably walked by the table only once after the food was served. Both my water and soda supply was depleted, and she was no where to be seen. As I near the end of my steak, I finally catch a glimpse of her and wave her down to ask for a refill on both. She tosses my soda and water onto the table and quickly runs off again. It's times like these where I question the mandatory 18% gratuity rule. 3 stars for OK food for a HIGH price."
504,Once again this restaurant does not disappoint.  Four of us went here for breakfast on 7/4/11.  Food and service were great.  Location is excellent.  Love the Bloody Marys!
505,"My brunch experience here was very disappointing.My croque-madame was awful. I asked for my egg to be over easy, and it came out dry, flat, and completely cooked. Not at all runny. (To his credit, the waiter noticed, apologized, and asked if I wanted the egg redone. I just wanted to eat and get going, so I declined the offer.) The bread was thin and dry, and the ham and cheese were thin and greasy. I usually expect Bechamel sauce and a side salad with my croque-madame at nice restaurants. I am one who doesn't like leaving food unfinished, but the sandwich was so unpleasant that I left half of it untouched. If a French place can't make a good croque-madame, it immediately loses a dozen points in my book.I ordered a salad. It was tiny. Nothing special. Definitely not worth $9.The only part of the meal I enjoyed was the complimentary loaf of warm bread. Apart from the food, the indoor seating is a bit too dark and chilly for a pleasant brunch. We came here hoping for outdoor seating with a view of the Bellagio fountains, but the wait was too long so we opted to sit inside instead."
506,"This review pertains to the lunch menu.The Skinny: Gabi is not your friend - while the view est magnifique,  the food n'est pas tres bien (2.5), Service: efficient but tries too hard with the ""mon-sir"" and ""bon-jouer"" (3), Value: not that great considering the level of cuisine (2).We've been to Mon Ami Gabi for lunch a couple of times mostly because of the spectacular view of the Bellagio. Accordingly, the food is a bit overpriced for what it is. We subscribe to the ""Lettuce Entertain You"" rewards so I got a $15 gift card on my birthday. We ventured here for lunch (with an Opentable reservation).We ordered the country pate, the butter lettuce salad (with asparagus, beets, and goat cheese), and the croque monsieur. We've previously tasted their lovely skate dish and their great burgers but we decided to try something different this time. Bad move.The butter lettuce salad was meager for a $10 dish. A small dish of butter lettuce with some scatterings of asparagus and beets underneath. An overly large slice of goat cheese (closer to a feta cheese than a chevre) made the salad overly salty. The dressing, a creamy concoction reminescent of ranch, just doesn't work with the texture of the lettuces (it's too heavy) nor the flavours.The country pate is yet again, overly large portion of meat with only 4 thin slices of bread. The pate is not quite what we expected. There's too much meat, not enough fat which made the pate hard to spread and not nearly as decadent as it ought to be (it might be unfair but I had a great pate at Fleur de Lys a day ago).Finally, the croque monsieur. At a place like this, a croque monsieur ought to be better. First of all, no bechamel sauce - you can't have a high end croque without a nice bechamel sauce. 'Nuff said. Bread sliced too thinly (making it too hard when toasted), with very little in the way of ham or cheese, it was hard to justify the $12 pricetag. The bread was also a trifle greasy for my tastes. The accompanying frites were okay - more like chips than fries.Despite her really laboured/butchered French , the waitress herself was efficient, prompt and kind. She checked on us frequently enough and ensured our beverages were always filled.Overall, it was an okay experience but I have definitely eaten more authentic French cuisine at a better value. (FYI -The above three items plus a diet coke would have cost well over $30 if we didn't have the giftcard.)"
507,We ate here while visiting Vegas for a few days and it was the best food we had. The indoor patio is a dream. They use some sort of voodoo magic to make you feel like you're sitting outside in the sunshine while keeping the place at a perfect 75 degrees. The food was delicious and fresh. We had the tuna burger (rare) and the crab salad sandwich. Both were so refreshing and light. The housemade frites are awesome as well. Definitely eat here. You won't regret it!
508,"Let's start at the reservation.  Considering that I had made one about 4 hours before I wanted to arrive and was sucessful at making one ONLINE? That was pretty impressive.  Everything about it was very smooth and gave me no problems, even for a party of 7.My friends ordered the French Onion Soup as an appetizer, but I got to try some of it.  It was pretty good, not gonna lie.  I had a very nice texture to it and was definitely still warm while we ate it through.  It was a delicious blend of salty onions, but not too much of anything.My friends and I ordered a variety of steaks, all of which were pretty good.  I ordered the Bernaise one, which was pretty good and probably why I gave it the 4 stars.  The meat was medium-cooked as I had ordered it, but my friend who had ordered medium-rare was a little too cooked for it to be considered close to rare.  But other than that the quality of the meat was pretty good, and the difference sauces for the steaks seemed to go well with all of them, although I did wish that my Bernaise sauce was a little stronger and had a little more kick to it.  Service was pretty good; they kept coming back to check up on us, however they were a little pushy on trying to get us to order more, like a bottle of wine, which we did anyways.  I won't comment on the wine because I haven't had much experience with wine, but I thought it tasted fine and pretty good with my steak.So, overall4-4.5 starspretty good quality steakexcellent service (reservations included)seemed to have a good wine selection"
509,"Wonderful food, great service and the soups are always good!"
510,"Was it a bit tourist-y to sit on the patio strictly to watch the Bellagio fountain shows? Yes! Was it worth it? Absolutely.  Not only was the scenery second to none, but the food we enjoyed was a treat, as well. We were able to get seated on the patio in about twenty minutes without a reservation during dinner, which was very nice also.As we had been pretty gluttenous already, we decided to share a few items instead of ordering full meals.  We shared a delicious and reasonably-priced bottle of Vouvray, the best french onion soup I have ever tasted, a huge fresh crab cake, and an order of frites, which are very crispy and salty.  It was really tremendous, and our server was prompt and helpful in menu selections.  I practically had to be rolled out onto the Strip following the shared meal.  I can see that many Yelpers have had varying experiences at Gabi... some as great as mine, while some were left feeling disappointed.  I think if you are looking for a scenic place to enjoy a meal, you won't be disappointed if:  you are seated on the patio, sample the french onion soup and share a nice bottle of wine.  I might go elsewhere for an unrivaled steak dinner, but the experience I had was exactly what I was looking for."
511,"Delicious everything, great service, great setting and inside a hotel I'm very fond of. Came for a nice dinner out with my mom while she was in town and I wanted to try Mon Ami Gabi; it was definitely the right choice. Our waiter was very attentive without being overbearing (that's hard to do since he came around often but was just so polite and not pushy at all). We had reservations for 8 pm and when we arrived had a 10 minute wait, so we went to the bar to grab drinks in that time. I had a Bloody Mary and my mom had a Lemon Drop Martini (very good). We were seated just in front of the kitchen so there was a lot of traffic going by. In some restaurants I think it can be annoying but it didn't bother me here. Everyone seems very professional, which is how it should be! A lot of people dress up but there are also others dressed casually, so whatever floats your boat, but they do have a no sleeveless shirts requirement for men.I had the French Onion Soup (yum), my mother had the Chicken Liver Pate which she absolutely loved (I don't really like or dislike pate so my opinion is void), and then we shared the Hanger Steak (the merlot butter was so delicious) and the Seared Sea Scallops. I ordered the steak medium rare but would get medium next time since it was a little tough to cut. Those are seriously the best scallops I've ever had, tasty and soooo tender. My mother also had 2 glasses of the Sauvignon Blanc which was very very smooth. What was refreshing to me was the music. It wasn't just piano instrumentals to fall asleep to, but they played a lot of Norah Jones mixed in with contemporary soft rock/pop songs. That might sound weird how I'm describing it but it was contemporary while still being appropriate for the setting.Our total was just over $100 including drinks and tip which I completely think is worth it for fine dining without being stuffy and amazing food all around. We were too full for dessert but I'll definitely be back for that steak and to experiment with their specialty drinks menu. I'd also like to sit outside when the weather isn't too hot, it's fun to people watch!"
512,"07/06/10Sure, Mon Ami Gabi serves mostly tourists, but the service and their food was phenomenal.Three of us had a bottle of Jean-Louis rosé sparkling wine. To start, we had chilled cucumber soup, frisee and bacon salad, country pate, and escargots. It's worth to come here just for their bread, we had three.The salad was made French style, lightly dressed and refreshing, just like the soup. Pate and escargots were very appetizing, along with our view of Bellagio's fountain on the patio.We finished our lunch with double daily sorbet (green apple) and macchiato with a shot of Amaretto. I wished they had sweet crepe for desert!p.s. Elizabeth was a very attentive and good server!"
513,"This is probably one of the best steakhouses I have tried. Its definitely a tourist attraction, but who cares if the food is delicious and the service is great..right? The atmosphere is dark, dim lights and fancy decorations. To sit outside, it takes about 30-45 minutes, but we were all too famished to wait any longer. The waiters were kind and helpful. Our waiter came around every 5 to 10 minutes or so and water was immediately poured. Thats what I call REAL customer service.  I ordered the filet minon avec de frites with the creamy  butter sauce  instead of the red wine (forgot what it was called). And I must say that the meat was perfectly cooked. It was so tender and juicy, it had the right amount of salt and pepper - you didn't need to put any more. Most steakhouses fail to cook their meat right because they usually come out burnt, overcooked and rubbery, but this place surpassed the failure. The fries weren't the thick potatoey kind, but they were different (in a good way). Their fries texture were somewhat similar to Potato Chips or Pik-Nik fries. It was combination of those with real fries. if that makes any sense lol. The portions are a lot smaller than what most steakhouses serve, but you will be very full.  I was unable to finish the rest of my own plate! The meat is cut in shorter pieces, but they are pretty thick. My family ordered all different kinds of steaks and tried from each one and all of them were pretty delicious. None overcooked  or rubbery whatsover. I will be sure to come back to this place once I come back to visit Vegas again. I recommend this place for those who enjoy steak.  I hope it remains the same."
514,I was able to try the salmon dish and also the filet mignon w/ merlot sauce.  they were able to impress me on both dishes.
515,"Next time I'll make sure I make reservations for the outdoor seating since its directly adjacent to the bellagio watershow, but the inside of the restaurant was nice as well. Make a note that you must have somewhat formal attire or else they won't seat you. They weren't too pricey for the amount of food you get, you can definitely order one entree for two and an appetizer and that would fill you up, they also give you warm fresh baguette as well. I had the sole fish with frittes and veggies and it was amazing... melts in your mouth and puts a smile on your face for sure! French onion soup was pretty good, it's a pretty big bowl so don't underestimate the portions they give you. I think every entree ordered at the table including the salmon salad was delicious. For a table of 4 entrees and 1 appetizer, the bill came out to be $90, not too bad for a nice restaurant in vegas."
516,"Met coworkers here for Sunday brunch on one of the rare fabulous day, where Vegas is actually not hot as he11 in the middle of Aug.  Thank the rains early this morning and the slightly overcast sky for the awesome 90F temperature.Anyway, we were seated in the patio area facing the Fountain of Bellagio.  Unfortunately we were way too early for any of that signature spectacle, otherwise it would have been an memorable end to a fantastic casual breakfast with friends. But let's get down to the meat of the review.The restaurant was not full inside when we arrived, and we were greeted by three friendly hostesses at the front desk.  The patio seating area was completely packed by 9am, so business was excellent.  Our waitress greeted us with a friendly smile, took our coffee order and proceeded to explain the specials of the day.  We ended up ordering a mushroom omlete, crepe-like stake of cinnamon pancakes (these were huge), and I ordered the special eggs benedict (served with roast beef and caramelized onions).Overall, I wasn't impressed with the food and here are my reasons:The Hollandaise Sauce for my eggs benedict was already starting to break when it was served.  The roast beef was way overcooked and there were very little of it tucked under the poached eggs.  The side of ""breakfast potatoes"" aka hash browns reminded me of Denny's.The mushroom omelet was okay. It is nothing fancy, and you can probably get similar quality omelet at IHOP, but the view and ambiance is better here.The crepe-like pancakes - these were nice and thin and fluffy. The flavor was excellent.  Worth it, since the food is delicious and more unique.Service:  Excellent & friendly!  Our coffee cups were frequently refilled. Condiments we asked for to make the meal better were delivered in a timely manner.Price: includes the Vegas Strip premium.Suggestions: For breakfast, stick to the fruit or non-savory breakfast items, it appears to be better.  Or come for dinner and lunch since those offerings appears to look better."
517,"I absolutely love this French steakhouse. I have to go to Vegas often for work, which does not make me happy, but I always cheer myself up with the prospect of going here for dinner. The interior is cool, very French, lots of light, but I like sitting outside in the evening to enjoy the Bellagio fountain shows. The restaurant's patio is directly across the street from the Bellagio. Now the food: woohoo! My favorite salad is the endive salad. It is extremely fresh and flavorful. I love the filet mignon here. They typically serve it in a merlot reduction, but I prefer to get it with the butter herb sauce, which is delicious and much lighter than it sounds. The pommes frittes are perfect, thin, crispy, great seasoning. And the flavors you will find here are indeed French."
518,Great food.  Great service. Great view in the front. An amazing night!
519,"For some reason our visitors from out of town want to head to Mon Ami. I only oblige them cuz I am a good host and I am a sucker for the view while sitting on the sidewalk. Other than the view, I just don't see it. Mediocre food to give it a compliment. As a steak house...there are over a hundred mo betta in Sin City."
520,"I always seem to stop here for dinner when I get into Vegas.  This time around I had the scallops and my husband had the salmon.  Scallops were good and the salmon was absolutely delicious.  I would recommend the Merlot butter filet Mignon but if you are not a steak fan then I would recommend the salmon.  The salmon was just cooked perfectly, not to dry but absolutely moist and with the rice underneath with the lemon flavor it brought out the flavor of the fish.....yummalicious!This is a great place to watch the water show across at Bellagio.  Reservations is a must because the line can get long at prime time and it is at first time first come for the patio, but I've found if you come around 5:30- 6:30 you have a great chance of getting patio seating.  Service was excellent every time I go there and I know every time I go to Vegas we will always stop at Mon Ami Gabi for dinner."
521,"Nice if you can forget that this place is supposed to be a French restaurant. Most entrees come with crunchies - fries or garlic chips, and I hope people don't walk out of here believing that this is what French food will be like if they go to the real Paris someday.However, as a steakhouse, it's good. I conspired with a friend to share his steak with bordelaise sauce, and both were delicious. In turn I got the skate and shared it with him. It was good, but not great - I was expecting more of a creamy sauce as is common in French fish preparation. But it was pretty dry and of course so were the garlic chips and the veggies on the side. Bread was nice and warm. Their creme brulée was so-so - they definitely left the torch on for too long on a couple parts of the shell, and I got a bitter, burnt taste in my mouth.Oh, and at the beginning of the meal 5 of us shared the scallop appetizer, which was good, but not good for the $16 it cost us.They have an alright wine list and this is the first place in recent history that I've been to where I can get Pouilly-Fuissé by the glass -- which is great, because I'm too cheap to get a whole bottle.Not cheap, but worth going to if you want to get a good steak. Just don't look at it as a French restaurant."
522,"Just like France.Well I have never been but it seems right. I have worked with enough Frenchmen to know that this is the way a French kitchen and service is to run.Our server came with speed and accuracy. I noted all the little details as a Chef. The waiter passed our table numerous times, slowly, in case we needed to call. A masterful waiter will anticipate your needs and make themselves readily available. This was bliss.Not to mention the food was cooked to succulent perfection. My steak was juicy and topped with a Gorgonzola heaven. While my beautiful partner ordered some anti-salty corned beef. I came out of this place unlike any other place in Vegas, only down $60 bucks and happier than when I came in."
523,"Mon Ami Gabi is a great choice for lunch or dinner on the Strip. The service is very good, and it's not as expensive as a lot of other places further up the Strip in the Venetian or Palazzo. In addition, the scene outside is unmatched, and being on the patio across from the Bellagio fountains is a romantic setting. Everything I've had here was well above average, the tomato salad, escargot, steak au poivre were good, but the frites and profiteroles were amazing."
524,"This place is awesome! Great view, great steak, and great service. This is a must eat in Vegas for budget steak. The $20 hanger steak with mashed potatoes was great stuff. I know good steak and Mon Ami Gabi did amazing. This place was really crowded but they got us seated quickly. The appetizers were so so but the steak and mashed potatoes changed my attitude about this place immediately. Do not order the french onion soup. Very tasteless. STEAK STEAK STEAK with merlot butter! Recommendation: Hanger Steak w/ Mashed Potatoes.Note to try: French Toast dessert"
525,"The patio is perfect and the food is really good. My favorite dishes thus far are the chocolate and bacon waffles, the bananas foster waffles (foster sauce on the side), steak frites and the corned beef hash. The bacon is perfect. I wasn't too crazy about the lemon pancakes. I can't wait to try dinner here. I plan to order a steak."
526,"Really wonderful. Better than I expected. Our server was wonderful and really attentive but didn't hover. She knew the menu in and out, which is important to me since I'm that annoying diner who asks loads of questions. They bring out a delicious and warm baguette to get you started with their shaved carrot 'accoutrement.' I honestly don't think it's a French dish, but nevertheless, it was tasty. Herbs, vinegar, and something else I couldn't put my finger on all blend nicely with the carrot. We got the jumbo shrimp cocktail to start - most of their appetizers were shell fish related and my honey is allergic, so the shrimp had to do. It was tasty, and their cocktail sauce had the lovely horseradish punch that I love. The only downside was the shrimp tasted a little 'fishy' to me. I had an heirloom tomato salad with basil pesto, goat cheese and baguette croutons. I would have been happy if dinner ended here. The tomatoes were so flavorful and the goat cheese was really nice with the acidity. We both had steak for dinner. It's a steakhouse after all, why go against the grain? We chose their classic cut which is pounded thin. I was worried about the doneness and tenderness of the meat, but was pleasantly surprised to have a perfectly medium steak that was anything but tough. I chose to have the Roquefort sauce while the man went with béarnaise. Their béarnaise was authentic and really quite good; I've had terrible representations lately. Now, possibly the best thing about dinner were the impossibly thin and delicious frites that they serve. What machine cuts then in such a way, I haven't the slightest, but I want one in my home! They are crispy, perfectly fried and lightly sea-salted. Moving on to dessert (and honestly, we should have stopped to avoid the utterly bloated feeling that was to come, but if you ever get to chance to eat this dessert-DO IT). We decided on the Banana's Fosters crepe. Best. Decision. Ever. There should be movies written about this crepe. I am a banana's Fosters fan to begin with, but this had just the right amount of rum to cinnamon to banana to caramel. Oh heavens...We really enjoyed our dinner here, and before tip it was UNDER $100. We were shocked. I even had 2 cocktails! Really worth it - and if you're lucky, you can get a seat outside to watch the Bellagio water show, too!"
527,"I've been to Mon Ami Gabi plenty of times -- and so I trusted it would be a  reliable dinner spot last time I was in Vegas. (July 25).  The patio is generally highly sought after, as it provides a great view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains. Surprising, even in 100 degree heat, there was an hour wait for the patio.  We elected for the inside and immediate seating.We were sat in front of the giant swinging doors where the servers/runners come out with all the food -- which meant that every few seconds the ambient light vanished and all I could see were giant flourescents and an assembly line worth of staff in the kitchen.  I wasn't pleased, but I knew I could ""manage.""Our server, Sarah, was nice enough, although I could tell just how corporatized the restaurant was (I never felt she was talking to me, but rather over me, as though there were too many other important things that needed her attention).  My boyfriend and I only eat organic meat, and so we were turned off by their ""grain-fed"" steaks advertised on the menu.  Instead, we went with $100 worth of appetizers and sides. Let me preface that all the items were simple items and nothing that required a long cook time.  We started with the chips and dip.  My boyfriend and I thought that these sounded good on the menu.  When we got them we thought they were like store bought Ruffles.  Fellow yelpers, pass on those, unless you are craving a generic potato chip.  (When we asked Sarah how they were, she didn't exactly give us an honest answer).I ordered a Caesar salad and the BF ordered the Tomato Salad.  Mine was $8.95 and his was $9.95.  His sucked.  The tomatoes tasted mealy and old.  My caesar was definitely better.  I considered it a save from the horrible chips.We also ordered the Mac and Cheese, Scallop app, crab cake, and steamed asparagus.  There were 2 tables on either side of us.  Each of those tables had their STEAK dinners looooooonnnngggg before we got the items we ordered.  I even called a manager over to complain as it had been well over 35 minutes since we finished our salads (and unfortunately, the wine hadn't got me buzzed enough to ignore my stomach).He quickly brought out the scallops and crab cake -- but no mac and cheese or asparagus.  When I looked at him confused, he said ""was there anything else?""  I was pretty annoyed.  He then brought out the mac and cheese and their garlic spinach.  I told him I didn't order the garlic spinach and he said ""well why don't you keep it because we'll just throw it out."" So I did, and he brought the asparagus.The crab cake was just ok as was the scallop.  We both have had better.  The mac and cheese was good enough and so was the asparagus.  The ""free"" spinach was horrible.  Overly sauteed and buttered.When the bill came, I noticed that I in fact was charged for the ""free spinach"" and then credited for it.  It appeared I was also credited for the asparagus.  I asked the server quite simply,"" after all that you are comping me $7?  It was insulting.I'll never go back.  I was overly disappointed in the service, the management and the food.Au Revoir Mon Ami Gabi."
528,"Another great spot to take out of towners or just a good date spot. The outside seating has to be the best in Vegas. Spectacular views of the Belagio fountains. Steaks and fish are great. Great wine selection and the prices are pretty reasonable for a nice strip restaurant. Service is fantastic. Make sure you get a seat up front. You wouldn't want to come here and miss the best part, the view."
529,The experience was great.  I expected it to be pricey and that's ok since I'm in vacation.I've experienced better for cheaper.
530,"The top 3 words to an ideal property is location location location!!!!! Mon Ami Gabi has completely captured that. Not going to lie, but even if the food was bad, people would still come in, watch the Bellagio show, and probably leave a little unhappy but still glad they got a pretty good seat.But here's the thing - they serve GOOD food.. great food I would say and at completely reasonable prices, not to mention the free music / water show across the street. We were able to make reservations for 9:30 after the Chris Angel show at the luxor, and although the patio is first come first serve, it happened to open up before our inside dining room table was ready. The waitress was patient, polite and helpful. We all got a great view of the bellagio which was breathtaking.I ordered the salmon that came with a bed of orzo. The portion was extremely large and the salmon was cooked beautifully. The orzo was well seasoned and I enjoyed every last bite. Watching my friends - their dishes were huge, including the size of mussels which looked like they had doubled in regular size. The fries ordered were unique, skinny and flat, something I've never tried before.No one's bank was broken after this as prices ranged anywhere from $ 15 - $25 dollars.. and a bit more expensive for the dishes that were out of the ordinary. Everyone was completely satisfied and the hot heat just made it a perfect night to site outside.I know people who have rituals to eat here everytime they come to Vegas. I would like to start this tradition myself the next time I come back!"
531,"Mon Ami Gabi est excellent; bon emplacement et bonne nourriture... Coming to Vegas twice a year for tradeshows, one of my fave must-eat spots has become Mon Ami Gabi. Easy on the pocket book, good ambience, fairly sized portions, and tasty through and through!Outside of the tourist trap it has become (I guess the location says it all), I prefer this restaurant to many on the strip for a quick meal. Close your eyes and your whisked away to Paris? Not really! But, the meals and service seem to fall in line with it's kitsch boho chic aesthetic. I'm a fan of vintage, what can I say...We had a lunch and dinner here this week, and both were handled very well. The burger at lunch, with an egg, was fantastic. So good in fact, the gf stole it and swapped lunches with me! Who said chivalry wasn't dead? I ended up having the open-faced crab salad sandwich, not great, but definitely fed my hunger appropriately.All in all, Mon Ami Gabi gets the thumbs up for always providing a good meal, day or night. Now back to writing the rest of my week of Vegas experience..."
532,"I live in San Diego mostly, but I've also had a place in Vegas for the last 4 years, and I've partied and eaten my ass off at every place there is.  That being said, this restaurant, by far, is one of THE BEST in Vegas for French Cuisine.  Not only is the food and service superb, but the ambiance is great.  Its a half outdoor/half indoor set-up right along the strip.  Start off with The Chicken Liver Mousse, Escargot, and Smoked Salmon.  The Roasted Chicken and Hand Cut Beef are two great choices for Entrees.Make sure you grab a couple great bottles of wine to pair with your meal (ask your waiter if you're not a wine connoisseur.)  Love it."
533,"As a huge fan of all things breakfast and brunch, I turned to Yelp for a recommendation and again Yelp came to the rescue!  My husband and I were seated in the sunny (but still cool, which is very important in Vegas) sun room of Mon Ami Gabi for brunch and started off with their crab cakes (well, 1 crab cake actually) which was delicious and unlike other crab cakes we've had, this one did not seem to have much filler and had huge chunks of crab!  I enjoyed my fresh blueberry french toast and my husband devoured his seafood crepe which had scallops and shrimp as big as my ear!  Service was friendly and overall it was a wonderful meal and experience.  We'll definitely be back!"
534,"Since this is an ""update"" it means I've eaten here now many times. It's always been wonderful. Each time it's a bit different because of the season or whether it's for dinner, lunch and now brunch (the menu changes as well) but never ceases to be enjoyable. We had brunch this time. I always love sitting outside and enjoying the French ""bistro"" cuisine at Mon Ami Gabi. I think we were fortunate to find a shady table since it was over 100 degrees in Las Vegas the day we were visiting, and we were determined to sit at a table outside. Keep in mind that nowhere else on earth can you sit at a classic French Bistro, savor delicious food, drink great wine and watch the Fountains at the Bellagio playing ""Viva Las Vegas."" Memorable! They may be famous for the Steak Frites, but I love the Country Style Pâté and the French Toast (which I had at brunch this visit) is fantastic, while my friend raved about the Corned Beef Hash and Poached Eggs with roasted red pepper (my stomach still ached from the nightmare of El Sombrero in Juneau so I passed!). Our waitress was wonderfully nice, very attentive and even was good enough to take a picture of us at our table. Truly memorable! I might even stay at the Paris next time just to be closer. Also, because of all the hassles and disappointment at the Aria, we ended up stowing our bags with the bellman here at the Paris. They were EXTREMELY courteous and helpful and urged us to come back and stay at the Paris next time. That was a great end to our trip and was really cool. Since the Aria was so bad, I think we will try the Paris next time... review to follow!"
535,"Excellent view of the strip (since the patio is right outside the Paris hotel and facing Las Vegas Blvd as well as City Center and the Bellagio fountains). Pricey, but that's what comes with the fantastic ambiance and high quality food.  I ordered the seared scallops dish, which was a generous portion and it tasted excellent.  All their entrees are served in very generous portions. The creme brulee was really good too.  I have a friend who goes there just for the desserts.  Great place to take a date."
536,"It's obvious the draw for this restaurant is the location. It sits directly across from the Bellagio fountains, which bodes very well. If it didn't I wonder if this restaurant would still be in business with Vegas' stiff  restaurant competition. Mon Ami Gabi is very loud and a fairly small restaurant, so I wouldn't recommend if you plan on having tons of conversations.We came here for celebratory dinner, I had the steak and frittes. The food wasn't bad. It wasn't great. It was just okay...and with the stiff competition in Vegas, that's just not enough (particularly for the price). The steak was properly cooked with a decent sauce. Bottom line is: I'd only recommend if you want a stellar view of the fountains and don't mind paying quite a bit for okay food."
537,"This is the first and last time I will go back to this restaurant. My ladies and I were there for a nice girls night out and we've never experienced such poor service in a restaurant like this.  It started with the bitchy hostesses, then continued on with the water guys and the two servers we had.  I had to give 3 stars because the food was delicious. I had one of the steak w/ frites and their yummy creme brule.  I don't care if their food is delicious, I don't need to drive to the strip and waste money on this place that treats you like crap."
538,"We were looking for a place to eat breakfast this morning and I did some searching on Yelp, it looked like the Paris Casino and Hotel had several good option, the first that had come to mind was the crepe place inside the casino. However, we did walk by Mon Ami first and I must admit I wanted to stop right then and there and grab a table. However, we went through the hotel and saw the crepe place and decided that we should go back to Mon Ami.We were seated quickly, opting for an outside table as it wasn't too hot out yet (it has been up to like 108 most days we have been here). The waiter quickly brought us ice waters and a soda for my wife and a fantastic cup of coffee for me. He told us about their specials and we looked over the menu and decided upon out breakfast.I went with the traditional Eggs Benedict and my wife had poached eggs, sausage and toast. Being an amateur baker I also wanted to try their ""Homemade Brioche"", the waiter tried to talk us into blueberry french toast instead, which did sound tasty, but I really wanted to try their brioche, as to compare it to the brioche that I have made myself.Our food took a little while to come out, but our waiter kept our drinks refilled and remembered to bring me more creamer when it looked like I was about to run out. Our breakfast came and everything looked good (I will post pictures later). The toast that came out for my wife's breakfast looked like it came from a nice rustic loaf and was cut on the bias. We enjoyed our food and I munched on the toasted brioche, smearing it with butter and jam (though it really didn't need any more butter). I found the brioche to be good, but my preference would have been for a bit more honey and to have it be toasted a little bit longer.All in all, the meal was good, the service was excellent, I would definitely have breakfast there again!"
539,"LOOOOOOOOOOVED it!!!! I definitly will go back there again when Im in town. The food was Excelent and cooked perfect. the waiter was amazing on keeping up with everything. It was kinda pricey but well worth it. Just keep in mind when you order a steak, also order a side dish as well. Cuz basically with the steak.... thats just it."
540,"Ambiance:It's huge (...that's what she said). A French version of a cheesecake factory. I've been spoiled with too many Emeril/Keller restaurants to think that the ambiance was romantic or intimate. BUT it was great for a large group. Plenty of seating and the view of the Bellagio fountains (even inside the ""covered"" patio) was nice. Food$31 for filet mignon is pretty fantastic. The sides of green beans and asparagus are delicious (though anything with that much butter is.)$8 for a wonderful glass of Pinot Noir? Wow. Everyone at our table ordered something different. From the moist chicken dishes to the hearty steaks we were all happy.If they have the Bread Pudding dessert with caramel topping & vanilla bean ice cream (not on the menu. It was a special for the night) you need to get it. It was rich and sweet and definitely large enough for 2-3 people (we were a party of 5 and were satisfied!)Service:The hostess was rude. She was a 21 year old girl that held up her finger, didn't make eye contact and said ""one sec"" after my boyfriend said ""hello we have a reservation for 5 at 7pm"". I don't care if you're listening to some critical information in that ear piece of yours about table availability. Learn to multi task. Provide decent service to the PEOPLE in front of you. Smile. Give a little head nod. Something..   Luckily we didn't end with service like that. The girl who escorted us to our table was very considerate in moving us to a ""better"" one away from the doors when we requested it. Our waitress was fantastic (she took my steak back b/c it was medium rare and made it medium well for me and she recommended an amazing dessert). Overall:Very reasonably priced dinner and wines. I don't know if I'd come back (too many great places to try in Vegas) but I'd definitely recommend everyone try it once, especially if you're looking for a more budget friendly restaurant (vs. Mario Batali's or Hubert Keller's). Just make a reservation (Opentable!) because it's a little hectic in there."
541,"For my wife's 30th birthday, we wanted to have dinner at a nice restaurant with our friends.  We knew that we didn't want to go to chain restaurant like Maggiano's, but we also wanted to make sure that the place wasn't going to be too pricey.Unfortunately, due to the size of our party (20+), unless we went to a buffet, we were required to have to do a set menu.  This made finding a restaurant more difficult as the costs go up with a set menu, and you often have to settle on whatever food options they give you.  Most of the restaurants we checked out were in the range of $100-$150 per person.  And if you wanted to have beef on your menu, you were looking at the upper end of that range.Thankfully, with enough research, I was able to find Mon Ami Gabi.  Not only were their prices significantly lower, but they also allowed us to customize our menu.  So we were able to choose as little or as many courses as we wanted to serve -- some of the other restaurants had 5 or more courses in the menus that included beef, thus leading to the high prices -- and we had the freedom to populate our set menu choices with any of the items from their normal menu.  So we searched through the Yelp reviews to find the best selections to put on our menu.  We ended up creating a menu that was only $50 per person.As for the food itself.  It was absolutely delicious.  There's a reason why this place is rated so highly, the food is that good.  And our server was incredible.  She did such a great job taking care of us and making everything go smoothly.  We made sure to give her some extra tip on top of the mandatory large-group gratuity that was included in our bill.We were definitely impressed with Mon Ami Gabi.  It's become one of our favorite restaurants in Vegas.  And if you're thinking about having a nice dinner with a large party, definitely consider Mon Ami Gabi.  Rebecca Kozdron, the Special Events Manager, did a phenomenal job in helping us plan our amazing dinner."
542,Not bad the food is good service was on point the view was great. my wife had theQuiche My buddy had the Smoked Salmon I had the Steak Sandwich. We each said the same 3 stars
543,"I ate dinner at Mon Ami Gabi, the shrimp cocktail was not clean.  They brought another one it was very salty as well.  The food not great.  I have eaten there for lunch as well in past years lunch is fine the salads are good.  If you have the extra money to spend the best Steakhouse on the strip in my opinion is PRIME in the Bellagio."
544,Sat on patio and watched Bellagio's water show while eating. Was amazing! Great view. Try the filet mignon or the steak with bleu cheese atop... very good
545,"My experience at Mon Ami Gabi was just okay. I think the number one thing that was the most disappointing was that some of the dishes were lukewarm. The french onion soup tasted great but because it wasn't hot, the gruyere cheese didn't ooze like it usually should. We also tried the croque madame, eggs benedict, and french toast. I think the food was all, on average, decent, but nothing gave it a ""WOW"" or spark. The bread was super dry and crunchy, with a hard to chew consistency. Although the food could have been better (in my opinion), the view was amazing! Of course, the Bellagio water show goes without saying, and it was such a great place to sit and watch during a hot summer day in Vegas! But, I think I would rather try other brunch spots in the area. Maybe this place would be better suited for dinner!"
546,"My boss kept on buggin bout this place because he heard it was a nice place to eat and u can watch the water show outside of Bellagio when you eat in the patio. So we got to this spot and it was a 2 hr wait to sit in the patio. That was a hell naw! So we ate inside and its dark as hell in there! I couldnt even see the menu. Plus the waitors had that French accent and couldnt really understand that! I think the darkness in there affected my hearing also!!! It was funny kuz I asked the waitor how the Salmon is cooked and he said ""panned"" but i couldnt understand the way he said it. So I kept on sayin ""HUH?!"" and he finally got rid of his French accent and spoke to me in plain English. I was like ""THANK U!""I ordered the Salmon which was ok but i had better. We ordered chips for appetizer and that damn thang was stale! Unless thats their style of chips, i have no clue... my style of chips is crispy!!!So overall, this place sucked in my opinion. I rather eat at Cheesecake Factory and have their salmon - YUMMM!!!Thank goodness my company paid for this meal also!Never Again Mon Ami Gabi. BTW, i kept on forgetting the name of this spot so i was calln it Milli Va Nilli!"
547,"I could smell my seared scallops dinner before it was placed in front of me on the table. Then, poof, gone. I wish I had savored my dinner more.Enjoyed the outdoor patio too -- great people watching and a relaxing way to watch the Bellagio fountains."
548,"We had reservations for Saturday on Labor day weekend. We were promptly seated with no problem. Super great service. Our waiter was amazing - described everything we wanted to know in the menu without being pretentious and even gave recommendations. Food came out swiftly and delicious. The portions are large, which made me happy. I also enjoyed the unique selection of french fare, like escargot and imported cheese. We had the sangria for the table, filet mignon, salmon, Bordelaise steak, and Au Poivre steak. All were great, I would suggest the oysters and filet mignon. We had no room for dessert, but we'll be back!It's not the most exquisite french food or exotic, but I enjoyed: the taste, portion, atmostphere, customer service, and especially the price. Cost the same as a Cheesecake factory, but you can't get Mon Ami Gabi everywhere!"
549,"Went here for breakfast for labor day weekend after searching online for a good place. The weather was unfortunately a scorching 105 degrees, so we decided to sit inside instead of taking the view on the patio of the Bellagio fountains (which ironically was what we chose the restaurant for).We came without a reservation, and got seated quickly. After ordering, our food didn't take long to come out, and everything tasted pretty good overall. I can't remember the name of what I ordered, so I guess that testifies that it didn't really stand out for me. I don't usually eat a big breakfast though, but you gotta have something in your stomach when you're walking the strip!Our waitress was fabulous, wasn't offended when my bf asked for hot sauce, and gave us a teenie, tiny, bottle of tabasco. Check was promptly given and taken care of, so we were in and out in a timely manner. We'd definitely visit again (and next time for dinner - and hopefully a great view!)."
550,Having lunch here is always worth the wait!!
551,"Food here is average and below my expectations. Most of the time i agree with the ratings on yelp reviews but this time I don't think this place is 4 stars. First of all I think the food here is more ""American"" than ""French"". Maybe it's a different type of French styled food I haven't tried but I've been to several French restaurants and their flavors are more complex and rich. Which leads me to the second reason why this place is average. Food here is pretty plain. There is nothing fancy or great about their flavors. We ordered steak frites, scallop for appetizer, and the cod with eggplants. Sure their steaks, cod, and scallop were tender and juicy but other than that there is nothing else good about it. Service was very good and their food portions are pretty huge. This is the second place the food disappointed me in Vegas based on Yelp reviews."
552,"I don't know what people's problem is, because I loved my dinner at Mon Ami Gabi. A steak dinner on the strip, with a great view and reasonably priced. What more could you ask for? Ok sure, the steak could be thicker, but it's perfectly cooked with delicious sauce and a huge side of perfectly thin, crispy frites! Plus you can easily upgrade to a filet for a few dollars more. I was torn between having the french onion soup or the macaroni gratin on the side but I quickly decided on the macaroni. Boy was I glad I did! The side is plenty for 2 to share and sooo delicious! Plenty of creamy cheese sauce and crunchy breadcrumbs with parmesan! YUM! They have a nice list of wines by the glass, I went with a spicy Cote-du-Rhone that complemented the steak perfectly.Personally, I think it's pretty hilarious that people are concerned that this is a tourist trap. I mean, HELLO! it's on the strip! Isn't this whole street the glaring, glittering, bare-assed definition of a tourist trap? Given everything surrounding it I think that this place is a gem and an exception to the  Vegas rule of being over-the-top expensive and more glitz than substance."
553,"This is what heaven must be like, at least if I were in charge.Fountain views and red umbrellas.  Filet mignon and lobster, accompanied by a cool Stella.  And, the best crab cakes I've ever had.Great way to spend those blackjack winnings, and to celebrate our two year wedding anniversary.  Cheers!"
554,This place was amazing.  The service was impeccable.  The food was delicious.   and the whole experience was unforgettable. i ordered the prime burger with brie cheese.  and my gf ordered the half mussel plate.  both of which were very tasty.  They also give you free bread to munch on and this weird picked carrot spread to use with the bread.  The servers were very nice and tended to our every need.The view was majestic.  Make sure you get outdoor seating if you can beat the heat.  How can you beat a view of the ballagio water fountains combined with the view of the bustling street view of Vegas?  5/5.  Recommended.
555,"This review is long overdue. By my count I have been here over 15 times and to Vegas now over 70 ... We all know that this place so hard to be french, the menu, the atmosphere, the wine, the waiters outfits .... who cares! They do one thing right -the FOOD!!!!In my opinion, a pace that starts dinner with slated butter and a warm baguette is already really high on the culinary spectrum. Over 15 times and food is still fantastic. Fillet had the prefect temperature, the liver pate is served just the right way with the miniature gherkins and onions. It's paradise, especially if you can score the outdoor table on a perfect evening where you can watch the Bellagio fountains and the people passing by. One thing of note: it is a tourist trap but than again the entire Las Vegas Strip is so if you are not happy with something coming from the kitchen let the staff know and they will gladly take care of it. We highly recommend reservations as this place tends to get booked on weekends. The food is good and by Vegas Strip standards is priced fair,Bon Apetit!!!!"
556,"For a night out in Vegas with friends this is a great choice. Our friends are locals and they insisted on taking us here. I was a little skeptic about the right-on-the-tourist-trap-strip location....but it proved to be a great place to hang out with friends.The atmosphere was interesting and fun. It was buzzing with tourists, locals, people on dates, groups of friends, etc. Pretty much all types of people where here....dressed in jeans to fancy dresses. So whatever you wear you'll fit in just fine. However, if you're wearing heels watch your step....this place is dangerous with all it's cobblestone, super slick and random steps. Whatever you do, you MUST sit on the patio. It's right across the street from the Bellagio fountains...and a arms width away from the street performers and drunk tourists wobbling down the street trying to find their hotel. People watching and me go hand in hand....and  this place was top notch. We tried the smoked salmon and crab cake appetizers ....both were just how I expected they would be. So far I wasn't completely wowed. Our friends said they have eaten everything on the menu here and have come to the conclusion that the trout and filet mignon are the best. So they got those, the boyfriend got the filet mignon with a wine sauce and I had a filet with blue cheese reduction. Everything came with the traditional French crispy fries....frittes. I'd pass on these if I were you....try another side instead. The sauces were really great, the meat was just ok. I've had much better steaks at chains. The prices were pretty expensive, but you should expect that at a steak house on the strip. However, you're paying for the atmosphere and in that case I say it was worth it. The service was great. Everyone was very attentive. That is....until they brought the boyfriend something he didn't even order. After having to prove our case with the waiter, and him telling us it would be 30 mins to get the ""correct"" order out...he finally did it. I think he wanted us to just be like ""oh ok...we'll just take this random food we didn't order, thanks anyway!"" I was pretty shocked that he was so rude about his obvious mistake. Good thing it didn't really taker 30 mins to get his order....otherwise I'd be really mad. Other than the order mix-up, this place was fun to try out. We'll probably never go back, but will always remember the great time we had on the patio with great friends. Next time, we're going to make our local friends try something outside of their comfort zone. ;)"
557,"service was pretty ok, when we went. there was a bit of confusion with our orders they accidentally put our order in twice. and my friend asked for scissors and they kept bringing out caesar salads.the food was decent, i had the salmon with lemon and thyme it was delicious but the portion was extremely small. my other friends had the sea scallops, portion wise it was small and unfilling. but she loved that the cauliflower was creamed and made to look like mashed potatoes. my other friends had salads that they said they could've made better on their own. it was also my friends birthdays and they got free cream puff desserts! this place really isn't that bad, just portions are small."
558,"Everytime I come to Vegas, this places is always busy - I knew we had to try it out. I made reservations, requested an outdoor seat and when I got there I had to wait 30 minutes. I understand that all of the outdoor seating is first come first serve so this wasn't too big of an issue. So for reference - if you want to sit outside with the view don't even bother making a rezzie, you'll be put on a wait list either way. We had cocktails at the bar right behind the outdoor patio, and the french martini was fabulous! We were sat down by a manager who was very friendly and the view was outrageous - directly in front of the Bellagio and their fountains. I ordered the Filet Mignon Au Poivre which was very good, and my boyfriend ordered the Filet with the lobter tail which he loved as well. We also ordered a very good bottle of Bourgogne, which was only 50 bucks! Such a great deal for Vegas - not the BEST steak but it was such a steal for a view, good wine, good food, and good service. Definitely reccommend Mon Ami Gabi!!!"
559,Great atmosphere! Divine steak and banana foster!!! Love it.
560,"The wait for the Eiffel Tower Restaurant was very long, and we were starving, so we opted for Mon Ami Gabi--which was a great choice. The food was pretty good and we had a great view of the Bellagio Fountains during dinner. We'd definitely come back."
561,"Personally I don't think i really enjoy my experience here that much. I think the most memorable thing about this place is that when you sit outside you get to see the Bellagio water show. I find that quite nice if you are enjoying your lunch or dinner and you get a pretty nice water show performing. Food was alright. I think if i never tried Zazie then this place might just be 4 stars but it just wasn't what I call AMAZING. I didn't expected much but for some reason I find myself leaving the place quite disappointed. I think the thing that got me the most was the fact that it was warm when the food was deliver to our table. I don't get it...the dishes should of just been cooked for us and the food is warm? If you are a pretty high up there restaurant, you just don't expect to see this kind of features. I'm just not satisfy with the fact that we were brought out with warm food. It absolutely makes no sense to me. I think the bread was very disappointing. I really hated the bread that they provided us. It just didn't meet any of my high class restaurant's bread. I mean I can go to Coco's and they can serve me better and more delicious bread than them. The bread was just plain dry and it was pretty hard to bite off a piece because it was crunch. YEA...didnt like it much. TO THE MAIN ENTREESI got the Croque Madame which was alright. After I tried Zazie, it's just alright in my book. The thing I find my Croque Madame quite oily? It's okaay i think i can kinda overlook that. I also tried the French Onion soup which was quite nice. I actually find the French onion soup the most enjoyable EXCEPT that once i dig my spoon under the cheese the soup was still quite warm. Which is a big WTF for me. I tried two other dishes but as yea I think the overall was an alright to me. Service...it was a so so. At first I thought the waiter was quite nice and refreshing because it seems like he is trying to have a great convo with us. You know after the main entrees was serve to us...it was like he became a ninja and just kinda disappear. The leaving experience was a lot worst.The reason why is that we asked for the check and he just forget about it. So we were sitting there for a good 10 mins until we finally asked for it again. THEN we finally got the check and leave.It's not a must try place in my book but I wouldn't kill myself if i had to come here again."
562,"I was a little dubious at going from Chicago to Las Vegas and ending up at yet another Lettuce Entertain you restaurant, but I was staying at the Paris and the location right along Las Vegas Boulevard and looking at the Bellagio fountains was very nice.  My friend and I went for a late lunch.  I had an okay glass of pouilly fuisse at $12, a $15 cheese flight of okay but grocery-store quality cheese and then we got the oysters.My friend very much wanted to treat me to something special and ordered a dozen oysters on the half shell.  They came to the table and we both looked at each other and hesitated because they smelled really fishy.  However, we both tried one and both had the same reaction: There was no way we were eating more.  I called the waiter over, let him know that we found the oysters fishy but that it might just be us and there was no need to take them off the bill.  His response? ""Whatever.  They're milky and people love them but if you don't like them I'll take them away.""  And he did.  We ordered the country pate and my friend got a seafood crepe that she liked.  The pate was okay, but the service was crap from that point on, of course.Oh, and the french bread sucked.  I should have known after so many Lettuce Entertain You disappointments here in Chicago that this would be no better.  I felt really bad that my friend shelled out $75 for such a mediocre lunch."
563,"Wow! Went here with a friend this past weekend. We got a table on the patio, had to wait 2 hours for it though. We were right on the strip at 9pm. We enjoyed wine, appetizers, first courses, steaks, then dessert. We spent over 3 hours just enjoying the view of the Bellagio water show. It was amazing. They are a steakhouse, so the higher prices didn't surprise me in the least. Great wine selection. They really pack the tables inside the restaurant. The patio seating is well worth the wait. The wait staff is amazing and adhered to the pace we set for our meal. I will definitely be eating here again!"
564,"we made a reservation for dinner on saturday night and got a great table almost on the patio, with a beautiful view of the bellagio water show. the wines by the glass, steak frites and roast chicken were very good and very reasonable. the portions were huge and service was very nice. it's a lovely restaurant amidst the surrounding vegas madness."
565,"I'm sorry for those reviewers that had a bad experience...ours was very satisfying and pleasant.  We were seated right away (we didn't sit outside).  The wait staff was friendly and attentive. I couldn't tell who was our real server because we were waited on my 4 different people--but all of them pleasant and our order came out fine, so I assume there was good communication between them.  We had the escargot appetizer--the snails were big and meaty, and the parsley garlic butter was great--not salty! The bread was fresh and hot.  He had the steak au poivre--the server was very helpful in suggesting the temp for both of our steak--i went with the filet with Merlot butter reduction. Perfect and flavorful.  No complaints from me in the slightest.  Very happy. It was a good last night in Vegas.  It would have been better if I won some $$, but...."
566,"One of my lovely coworkers brought me here for breakfast and we were seated on the terrace overlooking the strip on a warm sunny day. The atmosphere was wonderful! We both had coffee and shared a coffee cake. They give you a generous piece which makes it a great item to share as it's delicious with the coffee.We were both in the mood for eggs benedict, so my coworker had a regular Eggs Benedict and I had a Crab Cake Eggs Benedict. The food was fabulous. The quality of the food for the price is great, especially considering the location!The reason I didn't give a 5-star review is because of the service. It wasn't bad, it was just too casual for the restaurant and the waitress seemed rather unprofessional."
567,I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday dinner. We had reservations ahead of time so they took us right away. We got seated inside but at the window so we could still see the Bellagio show which was pretty cool indeed. Most people have to wait 40 minutes to get seated outside.Service was really good. Lots of menu options.But the food itself was just ok. I mean it tasted good and all but portions were a bit on the small end for my taste. I got the salmon and ate it in like 5 minutes and didn't feel satisfied at all. It needed more of something I felt.We ordered the creme brulee but it wasn't as good as the creme brulee at the M Buffet. The hard cover top was over burnt and a bit thicker than average. It took away from the overall taste.I'm not sure if I'd come back here anytime soon. I don't think I will. Service and food is ok but just didn't WOW me as much as I had hoped.Oh but we also got this grape flavored alcoholic drink that was super yummy!! hehe
568,"The best part of this place is watching the human comedy from the rail outside. Price is OK for the strip, high of course. Food at best is adequate. Order the oysters and a chef or cook is unnecessary. I love mac and cheese the French way. To make it good you need to add a ton of cheese, pepper and send it back once or twice to get the top really brown. It's a tourist trap and only worth the $$$ if you get to sit outside and watch Kansas go by."
569,"Came here for brunch on labor day weekend... the wait was not too long but it looked really packed! love the patio seating, great seats for people watching especially in the blazing heat.... but hey get some mimosas to cool you down.... they had a bloody mary bar which i thought was really amazing...they give u a plain bloody mary and you can add all your garnishes with a variety of olives, celery, all kinds of hot sauce!  i ordered the open faced crab sandwich, escargot and jumbo shrimps....food was good... i'd come here just for the great seats and mimosas mainly though."
570,"3.5 starsblueberry french toast: with homemade whipped cream on top 4.5, super yummychicken, brie, and apple crepe: very heavy on the sauce and cream: 3"
571,"Went here with my friend yesterday.  We thought we would sit outside and have a beautiful view.  They asked us three times if we were sure we wanted to sit outside.  Of course, there are umbrellas.  Yeah well, five minutes after sitting down we were sweating our butts off.  We should have definitely sat inside.  It was hard to enjoy the food, since we both ordered something hot and just wanted lunch to be over with.When you first sit down, they bring out bread and butter, which is so good!   The food was delicious!  I ordered the mussels and the broth that it is in is divine.  Something that I could eat all day!  Garlic, butter, sweet onions, parsley- YUM!  Nothing overbearing, but really good.My friend ordered the salmon over it looked like orzo and peas and she said that it was really good.The service was good and they let us change tables in the shade, but barely in the shade, so we ate fast and got out of there.  If its 80-90 degrees outside- SIT INSIDE!I'm sure that it would be perfect at night.  The view is incredible- you can't beat it!Can't wait to go back again!"
572,"I would've given this 5 stars just for the fact that we ate on the patio overlooking the Bellagio fountain. The filet mignon was cooked perfectly with an amazing merlot butter sauce and the most amazing crispy salty steak frites piled high on the side. These tasted like the old school potato sticks in the can, but when they soaked up some of the steak juices and sauce it was unreal. The one bad thing about the meal was the petite greens salad consisted almost solely of that frizzy green lettuce that tastes like bitter dirt. Maybe they like that in France, but I could've certainly done without it."
573,"What a treasure to find in the heart of Vegas.  Excellent food, service and reasonable prices.Try the blueberry French toast.  Absolutely amazing.  Everyone in the party loved them.  And corned beef and hash with poached eggs?  Doesn't sound like much but ironically it was the best corned beef I've ever had.  The crepes that my friends had were good - they rated them from good to excellent.  They have an awesome bloody mary bar for brunch as well so don't miss out on that even if you like your mary's virgin.After being robbed in a breakfast cafe at the MGM Grand the previous day we were surprised that a place that had such wonderful service for breakfast didn't charge more.  Although pricey compared to not being in Vegas our party was very happy with the pricing considering our location (right on the strip watching the Bellagio fountains) and the service (the best waiter we could have ever asked for).  It was the perfect Sunday morning brunch to end a long weekend.  Although we ate at some very pricey restaurants the service here was the best service I have had in a long time.  The whole party was so impressed we left our waiter a 30% tip - he absolutely deserved it.  I wish I remembered his name.Excellent service, excellent food and an excellent atmosphere deserve a full 5 stars.  Try it for breakfast, I don't see how you could go wrong."
574,"Mon Ami Gabi used to be my go-to place for brunch before we depart Vegas. What's not to love? Awesome view, delicious food, affordable prices. Not many of these on the strip.I love the the crepes--small but savory. The french onion soup is an eruption of gruyere cheese goodness. The steak frites are bizarrely addictive. If steaks are your preference, there's a vast selection here, but it's hit-or-miss. My recommendations are the bone-in ribeye (at 22oz, it's for serious eaters only!) or the filet mignon.Most people fight for the patio seats, but I actually like the pavilion because it's shaded and slightly cooler. Vegas can scorch when you're under the sun! Neither area can be reserved via Open Table.Unfortunately, my most recent visit was disappointing. The portions are noticeably smaller and the quality is slightly off. Still decent, just not as overwhelmingly perfect as before. However, Mon Ami Gabi will always hold a special place in my tummy."
575,Food is still great but the service was a bit slow. Plus the nerve of them to get rid of the bloody mary bar. that mad me a bit sad.Beautiful spot as always.
576,"Ugh.  How is this place so well-reviewed?  Spending ninety bucks for a meal that is, honestly, not even mediocre -- I don't see how that gets good reviews.I had the roast chicken, and my lady had a steak.  The steak was ordered medium rare, but was delivered beyond well done.  The chicken was actually cooked nicely, but barely seasoned at all and greasy.  Ceaser salad was maybe 3 ceaser leaves with very little flair of any kind, and not much flavor.The waitress was sweet, and our outside view was pretty.  The bread and carrot thing was tasty -- I still had high hopes at that point =).And the Frites -- how could you rave about them?  I found them old-tasting and unflavorful -- like a curled-up mass of stale pringles.  Maybe we just got an off evening, but the food was a severe disappointment."
577,"This is one of my FAVORITE places to dine in Vegas. Food is great and at a great price. Their steaks and frites are absolutely fabulous. When the weather is nice, I love sitting on the patio to people watch and see the Bellagio Fountains. The service here is usually great, but once in a while you get a not so great one. But that is okay, the food and environment makes up for it.I have been here several times, for both breakfast and dinner. It is so lovely to have breakfast at 7am on a late summer morning to just enjoy the surrounding. And I LOVE LOVE LOVE their breakfast selection. Quite pricey for breakfast, but worth it on occasions. I have tried their Fruit Bouquet, Blueberry French Toast, Banana Fosters Waffles, and Eggs Benedict.  Definitely need to go back and try everything else, because I know it will be amazing.During dinner, they provide you with a wonderful and fresh french baguette, usually with the carrot spread thing, unless they have some seasonal special, but even then, you can always ask for the carrot thing. I don't even like carrots AT ALL but I love this carrot thing with the bread. And the bread goes sooo well with the French Onion Soup and the Shrimp Appetizer (both delicious on their own anyways.) Their wine selection was nice. Their steaks are cooked perfectly, and serviced with a nice portion of frites! And I am a carb fanatic and these frites are amazing. Don't know what it is about them... but I never waste good carbs! I wish they had real souffle, but they still have great desserts. I have tried their flourless chocolate cake, chocolate mousse (pretty big cup of mousse for one person) and their ice cream dessert trio thing *pictures posted*.There's so many great things about this place. I recommend this place for all my friends and those who ask for a nice place to dine. You can make it all dressy and have a romantic date, or dress more casual for just a nice dinner. Great french dining without breaking your piggy bank."
578,"Every time I go to Vegas, I come here.  I love the food, great french onion soup!  You can sit outside, its across for the Bellagio and you can watch the fountains dance every 30 minutes while you eat.  Its great.  It reminds me a lot of the restaurants in Paris."
579,"Made my third visit to Mon Ami Gabi.  But this time was a change of pace as I went there for an early breakfast instead.  It was awesome!First off, Patio dining again, definitely a must when you go here as I've said before.  The atmosphere is a lot more different than it is at dinner time (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=gFFS-8Yc5e4B0s6VZiQtWg).  It's a little less hectic and more relaxing.  I could've just sat here and drank coffee all morning while people-watching.  It was that mellow.Started off with some fresh OJ and bottomless Coffee.  I was really craving a good Eggs Benedict so I ordered their Crab Cake Eggs Benedict (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=XMlXu9ZuqJ795S6cPb68fw).  That was really good, but then again, I'm a fan of any Eggs Benedict done anywhere.  But believe it or not, I thought it was the Hash Browns that stole the show.  They were cooked with caramelized onions so they had a nice sweet flavor, almost like latkes.  Good stuff!!Because I was there super early, I must've had like 20 waiters serving me.  Extreme service!!  It was like every time I would take a sip of my coffee, a waiter would come out of nowhere and refill it.  That was awesome!  I gave a big tip, but I wasn't sure who it was going to.I love this place.  5 stars once again!!!"
580,"If I had to title my review, it would be ""The Perfect Lunch.""I have been several times now and enjoyed each time.  This last time I was there, I was able to put all of those past experiences to good use to create exactly the experience I was hoping for.A few things to keep in mind if you have never been Mon Ami Gabi.  1 - The best place to sit is on the patio, however reservations are not good for the patio.  The patio is perfect for people watching, and what better place to do some people watching than on Las Vegas Blvd!?2 - Get there 10 minutes to 11 (when they start serving lunch), put your name on the list for the patio, take the square-light-up-vibrating thingy, put some money in a penny machine and wait to be called.  Our square thing went off a few minutes after 11.As far as what made this experience perfect, there were many factors.  We walked in and were seated on the patio at a table for two.  Our server recognized that it was a little warm where we were sitting (full sun) and offered to look for a table that was less sunny.  She found us the perfect table and it wasn't even in her section!  Plus, it was a four top, right in the center of the patio, in the shade, with the most perfect view of the Bellagio across the way.Of course, the food always plays a huge part.  A glass of house red wine to start is always nice.  The escargot was delicious, I loved using the French bread to sop up the garlic-herb butter left in the dish.  Our beautiful red and yellow tomato salad was light and refreshing with pesto and goat cheese, two of my favorite things! The steak sandwich was phenomenal.  Not too much meat, cooked to our med-rare liking.  Ciabatta was soft and caramelized onions were the perfect complement.  Frites were light and crispy with a little chew so you could taste the flavor and know you were eating more than air.  With the Bellagio fountain show kicking off shortly after noon (on Saturday) right as we were finishing the last of our wine and paying the bill.  This was one of my top 5 favorite lunches of all time!"
581,Best. Filet. Ever.  I'm usually a ribeye gal because the marbling adds more flavor. It sucks to order a filet and get something that more resembles a thick top sirloin but Mon Ami Gabi restores my faith in filet mignon.  You also can't beat the view if you're into people watching on the strip and a football field size fountain right in front of you.
582,"aww man what happened. new cook? Less butter? i don't know. Just went back for my second time and i gotta say i remembered it being a whole lot better. last year around new years me and my girlfriend found this place and decided to have dinner here. I ordered the roast chicken and it was amazing. So this weekend it was my girlfriends bday so we decided to go back to mon ami gabi and get the chicken because it was so freaking good the first time. womp womp not so much this time, chicken was kind of dry and didn't have as much flavor as that first night that i fell in love with this place. too bad i really did like this place it used to be five stars in my book. sad times"
583,"My second dinner here. Made a rez for 5:45p for three. Got there about 15 min. early, and requested a table on the patio. No Problem!! Keep in mind, it was a Wednesday night, not sure how quickly that would work on a Saturday. I love the atmosphere here. Lots of people to watch, the fountains across the street, and most importantly, great service. Started w/a glass of wine. We shared the warm cheese and tomato appetizer. Delicious!! They did have to bring us more bread, to completely devour this dish. I had the fish and chips. Chips are very crisp and salty...MMMmmm. Hubby had the scallops. I had a taste, and they were perfectly cooked. My son had the chicken Cesar salad, since I insisted he not order a cheeseburger. He liked it as well."
584,"This place gets worse with each visit. Very overpriced, mediocre food. A coffee shop with a view @  4 star Paris bistro prices. Can't believe some of the great reviews. Sad part it was really good when it first opened. If I can't get a patio table to go with oysters and mac and cheese I it. forget it."
585,"One of the best places for a casual outdoor lunch for the Vegas visitor.  Why?  Good food, good wine, excellent service, and entertainment provided by the fountains of Bellagio (right across the street).The country style pate is excellent and perfect for a light lunch.  The croque monsieur is also worth a try.  Simple and authentic.  It transports you right back to a café on the streets of Paris epically if you enjoy it with a glass of wine.The restaurant offers over two dozen French wines by the glass. All very well chosen although the prices are high.  Wines by the bottle offer a better deal.  All French.  All food friendly (no first growth Bordeaux or grand cru burgundies).  The wine program truly supports the café feel of the restaurant.Kill a few hours and people watch.  So it's a French bistro at a themed hotel.  Sometimes you just gotta be a tourist."
586,"Food was excellent! My sister had the filet mignon and LOVED it. I had the steak classique and it brought me great joy! Definitely recommended. Bring a sweater bc it's a little chilly, but well worth it."
587,"We were looking for something in between fast food and pretentious. Finally decided here because, frankly, I was tired of walking. Hostess said would be a30 minute wait, no problem I'll just gamble a little. 10 minutes later, our pager wentoff. Had to wait a couple more minutes while they changed out table cloth. Anyway, received water right away. Our waiter came over very friendly, outgoing. He recommended the skate because I was gonna order the salmon. My gf got the special, prime rib w/ aus jus macaroni au gratin and green beans . Skate came with a fennel, red onion, green bean salad..it was prepared with lemon capers parsley..and had homemade garlic chips. Garlic chips were great, light with garlic taste. Skate was an interesting fish, kinda chewy but the way it was prepared was delicious. A bit salty but im certain it was the capers. The lemon was delightful. Salad was good it was light and made with oil and balsamic vinegar. Prime rib was cooked med-rare, this was delicious.  So tender and flavorful, really good. My gf wanted to send it back because it was not hot...I assumed thats the French way..I didn't even notice and I like my food HOT! The potatoes were great, nice little crunch but great texture in middle. Almost forgot, i ordered the french onion soup and it was very nice flavorful, very cheesy-yummy, and bread was good. Try it just to try it. Nice little baguette with butter too. Overall, place was great and if it wasn't for this land having thousands of restaurants I would definitely make it back here."
588,"I love this place. The food is 4 stars but the view of the bellagio fountains are 5 stars. I ordered the trout with string beans and my boyfriend had the sea bass special with mash potatoes and mushrooms. The food came out so fast it's almost questionable how they made the food so fast. But I have no complaints, the fish was cooked wonderfully moist and flavorful. With 2 drinks and 2 entrees the bill came out to $60. The price is pretty reasonable when you consider the breath taking view. I ate my food slowly and got to enjoy the fountain show at least 5 more times."
589,"Very nice staff. The bartender was not ruffled by our Starbucks and even offered us napkins to rest our beverages on them.My boyfriend and I ordered the quiche as a snack, and it came quickly, and packaged nicely. At first, I thought the quiche would be too small for the two of us, but upon the first bite, we realized that it's not space that this meal is supposed to fill: it's the mental part. One quiche somehow managed to satisfy two people? Only if it's decadent enough, like the quiche, with it's sweet onions mixed in with the cheese, butter, and bacon. Oooo lord. I am craving it all over again.I love Las Vegas."
590,"I've always dreamed of going to Paris for all the perks and sight-seeing one can do in such a foreign place. Unfortunately, I've heard that the French aren't too fond of ANYTHING American :( Is that true? Because I like the French. Most especially the food! I haven't been able to go to Paris yet, but the Paris Hotel may be the closest I will get to being there for a while, so, I shall enjoy what I have at the moment.The very first time I went here was with my girlfriend on date. Often times we like to tour the city as if we've never been here and well, Mon Ami Gabi was already her favorite and she introduced this elegant place on the Las Vegas strip. I would recommend calling ahead for reservations as this place tends to become very busy and crowded. If you're lucky enough, request for the patio and it places you right across the street from the Bellagio fountains. It is a spectacular feat when you're with that special person enjoying a lovely dinner! :)As soon as your server greets, you'll be asked for your choice of drink. I'm a water person so, I'll always get water. For you wine and champagne drinkers, ask your server what they would recommend with your meal. The servers are pretty knowledgable of the perfect dinner match. They'll serve with French bread and a carrot salad or slaw. It doesn't come with very much flavor so if you're worried about ruining your palette for what's to come, you needn't worry.  We usually order the steamed mussels in a leek cream.  It changed recently so it isn't as great as it used to be.  The whole serving size isn't the same size as what it used to be, so you won't get as much as before, but still a tasty appetizer.And now for the main course.......Filet with red wine reduction and merlot butter cooked to medium :9"""""" yum! This is my girlfriend's favorite steak for 1) The flavor of the reduction with the merlot butter, 2) the merlot butter, 3) The way the steak is cooked to perfection so that it melts in your mouth! Mmm... The filet is also served with frites (french fries). I have tried the different steaks like the Steak Roquefort (bleu cheese sauce) and the Steak Bordelaise (red wine). It depends on the flavor you're craving but regardless of which steak you're ordering, your choice will always be a tasty one. I've returned numerous times to enjoy the service, the atmosphere, and most of all the food. I'm already looking forward to the next time while typing this review. So I would definitely return! Enjoy and happy eating!"
591,I love this place!  I've eaten here twice and both times have been tres magnifique.  Both times I had the skate which was unique and well prepared.  I can't wait to go back.
592,"Every time I come to Las Vegas I make a mental note to dine here, just for the view. On my second visit to Vegas, my girlfriends and I decide to have dinner there. After a HUGE lunch that included probably a stick of butter, a whole loaf of bread and ten strips of bacon (not that I'm complaining) I didn't want to eat anything to heavy where I couldn't fit into my clubbing outfit or be dancing the night away with a food baby. So I didn't get the steak and frites that everyone was raving about. Instead I had the lemon-thyme seared salmon with orzo, peas, leeks, spinach, and lemon butter. The salmon was a little bit dry but everything else was really good. It wasn't so heavy where I left feeling like I was 3 months pregnant. It was light and filling and the fact that I paid 25 dollars for a piece of fish the size of my 3 year old nephew's foot was overshadowed by the view. The view was beautiful, it was nice being able to look up to see the Eiffel tower, towering over my head. I also caught the Bellagio's water show about 4 times the whole time I was sitting there. I love love being able to watch the other tourist walking up and down the strip. Until I find myself a rich heart surgeon husband who will take me to Paris on his private jet,  Mon Ami Gabi has satisfy my curiosity for the ""Parisian"" experience. It's the closes I have ever came to Paris... that is until I visit Paris... Paris Texas the way my bank account is looking."
593,"Dined here recently with a group of five.  Had an excellent waiter, that was always present without being overbearing.  Most of us had the steak frites, and everyone was generally impressed.  I went with the Steak Roquefort, which was thin and tasty and had a large helping of fries.  The fries were a little on the thin cut crispy side for my liking.  The prices were good for Vegas and the meal was accompanied by wine, a decent chocolate mousse and coffee at the end."
594,"Patio is great but if there is a line, inside is nice too with the fresh air blowing thru.  So many great things about this place.  First, Frangria which a yummy french sangria (go with the pitcher it's cheaper).  Second, I am not a fan of tomato juice but had a very fun time watching people create their Bloody Mary masterpieces and the BM Bar.  Brunch here is tasty with lots of options.  I think it is difficult to go wrong.  The frites are so tasty like a classy really classy version of the potato sticks that come in the can.  Service was good by Vegas standards.  I definitely would go here again."
595,"I have walked past this restaurant many times...thinking it would be way too pricey...but by default of my party, we ended up here and really loved it!  There was a longer wait to sit outside to watch the Bellagio Fountain Show...so we ended up inside and had a great view with no wait! A few of us had the Spinach Salad with Grilled Salmon ($17) and another member had the Roasted Duck ($25).  Portions were generous and we could have easily shared a plate.  We all loved our dishes and would definitely eat here again and again! As for dress code - we were casual - I think the only rule is no bare feet or sleeveless t-shirts for men (collared T's ok)...and for the ""warm fresh-baked bread"" lovers - Si!"
596,"I fell in love with this restaurant.The food is so delicious....yet VERY reasonably priced for Las Vegas' restaurant standards. I ordered the Hanger Steak ($20) while my boyfriend order the Steak Bordelaise ($24). We substituted the pomme frites with mash potatoes and it was a good choice! We also added the Mac and Cheese (which was alright $6) and couldn't finish it because we were so full from our entrees.They don't take reservations for outdoor patio seating, but we were seated promptly in the center of the patio when we arrived at 10:45pm on a Friday night. Perfect view of the Bellagio water show. A lot of people around us only ordered appetizers and drinks and chilled until the restaurant closes at midnight. The staff didn't rush us out either.This is also the place to shamelessly make out with your significant other. I mean, everything was just so romantic and perfect! Twas a great place to start the night :)Highly recommended."
597,"On a recent trip to Las Vegas my mom and I stopped by this gem of a restaurant on the strip. The atmosphere was very pleasant. We sat at a table that overlooked the patio, so we were sheltered from the heat and wind but could still see the strip from our seats. We were there for brunch on a Saturday, where I chose the Bloody Mary Bar option. You can create your own using their buffet of delicious ingredients. They also have several other drink categories to choose from.Our waiter, Drew, was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He recommended several dishes, all of which we loved. I had the open-faced crab cake sandwich and my mother had a butternut squash quiche. Both were very well-prepared and in fairly large portions. As far as food in Vegas goes, this was very good and at a reasonable price!We left the restaurant extremely happy and glad to have had a break from the more superficial attractions of Sin City. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant!"
598,"Expensive but about average for a Vegas restaurant. The server was very friendly.The most important thing is, they will put a fried egg on a burger. BAM!"
599,Outstanding. Every part of it was outstanding. Try to get a table outside on the railing so you can watch the water show across the street while you dine.
600,"Since my parents are currently in Vegas on a business/leisure trip, I thought I would do a couple of reviews on some of my favorite restaurants I've visited when I was there a couple of years ago. These reviews may not be entirely accurate in comparison to today's current reviews, but nevertheless, they seem to fall well in line with most opinions on this site. Oh, Mon Ami Gabi, you are the closest thing to a bistro in Montreal, Quebec City, or heck, even Paris I've gotten to in awhile. I've dined at bistros in all 3 francophone cities, but I have to say, Mon Ami Gabi does a really decent job for being an Americanized French bistro. Plus, the waiters are a ton nicer than you would find in Paris so you don't feel as guilty about the pricetag because you know the level of service equals the quality of the food. I had steak roquefort, and loved the thin cut frites! If you do have an appetizer, go with the fruit and cheese platter. There were some cheeses I hadn't had before like a Belletoile. My parents enjoyed the wine selection from what I can recall as well. The prices were actually pretty excellent in comparison to other super expensive Vegas restaurants, so I felt like it was well-spent here. If it isn't too busy, ask to be seated in the glass interior patio area facing the Bellagio fountains."
601,"Best filet mignon (merlot butter, red wine reduction) I have ever had and probably will ever have in my life! Melts in your mouth. And the fries were crispy and magnificent! We went on a Saturday night for my friends birthday and we made reservations which is obviously the smart thing to do otherwise expect to wait a while for dinner. They do have a small bar in front and I think I noticed a bar facing Las Vegas Blvd inside. We got in right away and got sat at the most perfect table overlooking the street and smack dab in front of the Bellagio. They have an extensive wine list and we all ordered a glass of something different. They served us some sort of delicious grilled corn medley and fresh bread in a cute little baguette bag. We got to people watch and see the Bellagio fountains while enjoying a splendid dinner. (Our waiter even had a French accent, or a really good fake one!)"
602,"Have you ever had dinner with someone sitting across from you that you wanted to strangle?  Well I'm too nice to do such a thing but I was about to use my fork instead.  Why the hell would you try to order a calamari appetizer from a french restaurant without first looking at the menu, and then get mad that they don't serve calamari?  Luckily the food was good enough so that I forgot about the annoyance.  First the bread they serve was sooooooooo good.  The bread is a mini baguette roll that  tasted like it just came out of the oven.  5 stars alone for just the bread.We ordered the 'Escargots de Bourgogne' for our appetizer and we both ordered the Filet Mignon for our entree.  The 'Escargots de Bourgogne' was delicious and our Filet Mignon was even better.  I've been here before but I don't remember what I ordered the previous time.  I also don't remember it being as good as it was this last time.Service at Mon Ami Gabi was really good as I was checked up on constantly.  What's best about Mon Ami Gabi is that the price is really reasonable for the food being served.  I would expect to pay a little more...  I will definitely have dinner here again for their delicious tasting Filet Mignon."
603,"Maybe my new favorite lunch spot in LV.  I always passed by this place over the years and am glad I finally stopped in.  Spectacular views in front of the Bellagio fountains on the patio or enjoy your meal from the glass room.The escargots are very good as was my crab sandwich (open faced w/ a side of fresh potato chips).  Salads are a good option too, though maybe avoid the bacon salad as it's pretty small (waiter even warned against this).  Also fit in the french onion soup and banana fosters crepe as those are bomb.I generally hate Paris cause the pai gow gods despise me here.  But I'll come back just for Mon Ami.  Though I think the hostess had a bit of attitude and snobbishness (I mean get over it, you're not a Michelin restaurant), I'll deal with it."
604,"If you've never spent Halloween in Vegas, you can't possibly imagine what you are missing.  It is truly an unforgettable experience.  The costumes alone are worth the trip.  Never mind those ""racy"" costumes you see on the streets of Anytown, USA.  Here in Vegas, it's not ""Slutty Nurse"" or ""Slutty Cheerleader.""  The theme is just ""Slutty.""  It seems as though the whole town is trying to get away with wearing as little clothes as possible for it to still be considered a Halloween costume.The patio at Mon Ami Gabi is a PERFECT place for people watching on Halloween.  Normally, I would be gushing about the spectacular view of the Bellagio fountains (""gushing,"" get it?), but that day was all about people watching.  Since the moment we sat down on the patio, it was darn near impossible to concentrate on the menu.The dinner menu at Mon Ami Gabi is a very basic one.  This is French food simplified for Middle America.  ""When in doubt, go with steak frites"" - that's my motto.  This restaurant offers a wide variety of steak frites plus a limited selection of fish, poultry and vegetarian dishes.  There is even a burger on the menu, if one is in the mood for Le Big Mac or a Royale with Cheese.I opted for the Steak Bearnaise with frites and a bowl of sweet potato soup.  My soup came right away, and the presentation was impeccable.  A single piece of meringue looked very lonely on my soup plate, until the waiter brought and old kettle with a real spout and poured some pureed sweet potatoes around the meringue.  It was kind of like Ile Flottante, but with sweet potatoes instead of custard.  Presentation or not, my soup lacked any kind of unique flavor.  It could have used some spices (ginger?  cardamom?  allspice?).  I added some pepper, but that wasn't enough.  Also, did I mention that my soup wasn't even all that hot?  Come on, guys, you have a kettle!For a French restaurant, Mon Ami Gabi sure gives you large portions.  My steak frites came on a big plate, with a thin piece of steak literally covered in crunchy, thin frites.  The steak had been pounded with a tenderizer until it was as thin as a tortilla.  It was then marinated in wine (I am just speculating here), grilled and served to us.  It was difficult to say whether the quality of the meat was truly extraordinary, but the steak sure was tender.  Of course if you took an old shoe sole, assaulted it with a meat tenderizer and marinated overnight, it would be nice and soft as well.  The frites were not greasy and begged to be eaten with your own two hands, no fork required.  They were kind of like tiny specks of Lay's potato chips.We stayed there on the patio for another 20 minutes after we finished dinner.  Our evening was over, but the Halloween party in Vegas was just beginning."
605,"Eh, overpriced mediocre food, crowded, and waiters with fake French accents don't really move me. Yes, the location is desirable, outdoors overlooking the Strip and the Bellagio water show. On nice days expect waits for outside to be over an hour as we found out (we left and came back the next day for a shorter wait). Even with the wait they give you buzzers with a decent range so you can go to the bar or play some slot machines while you wait. Food was mixed at the table. The two of us with salads (a chopped and a spinach) were both dry. Across the table there were raves for the french onion soup and the escargot. Glasses of wine all around but it was mainly house wine. Service was a little slow, maybe because it was so crowded. The waiter did speak with a pushed-on fake accent which got to be a little more than just a bit annoying at the end. If not so crowded it would be a great place to sit outside and have a glass of wine and nicer appetizers than typical bar food."
606,"Great for breakfast, and the only place we go for breakfast when visiting Vegas. We usually order the Turkey Omelette and the Eggs Benedict. Service is great and the coffee is too."
607,"There was a 15 minute wait for the outdoor seating, which I will say go for it! Who wants to spend a beautiful Sunday morning in dim lighting? Just go play the slots and maybe you'll end up paying with your winnings. :)Crab Cake Eggs Benedict was sensational. Best crab cake I've had, but a little on the thin side. $15.95The Prime Rib with 3 Eggs was also tasty with a side of toast and hash browns. The complimentary jam is yum!!! Wanted to dip my fingers in and lick 'em. Which I sorta did, hehe! Only warning for this dish is the prime rib may come out more done than you wish. If you want medium, say medium-rare. $18.95Great atmosphere, but can be a little hectic with waiters and busboys running around. Add in chairs and heaters in minimal space and you'll find yourself in a tight spot, literally. Wish the fountains were on. Food wasn't piping hot. MIGHT try lunch or dinner."
608,"Thanks to Yelp, I've suggested this restaurant twice, once when I was with a bunch of girlfriends and the second for a company dinner. Both times we were not able to sit on the patio because there was a looong wait time and they don't take reservations. However! I have been pleased both times with the service, food, and ambiance. I think this is a good ""safe"" choice when looking to please everyone who might like different things. You've got steak, salad, soups, pastas, and more special items like lamb, olives in a jar, etc. It's a crowd pleaser for sure!"
609,"This restaurant personifies everything I hate about the Paris Hotel. It is too over the top in its efforts to match the French theme...and in doing so, sacrifices much of its quality.I visited this establishment when I was on a steak hunt...trying Rib-eye steaks at different restaurants throughout the US. The steak was decent, but in trying to meet the French theme, sauced the thing to death. Perhaps there are better options on the menu...maybe I just picked the wrong thing during my great steak hunt phase. But in my opinion, there are much better places to eat on the strip that don't involve a theme other than good food!This is my first one-star review. I would honestly consider giving it 0-stars if that were an option."
610,"My ex girlfriend and I ate here several months ago. I was just reminded of it and had a spare minute to write a review. This one will be quick.We had escargot, being adventurous and having not had it before. It was uneventful, somewhat bland, not very garlicky. Wouldn't order it again from this restaurant, but there's some chance that it's just not my thing - haven't tried it again since.Our main courses were alright. I had steak frites and the potatoes were oily and somewhat chewy, but the steak was decent and the dijon mustard sauce complimented it well. I don't remember what she had, but she wasn't very excited by it.After dinner, I had a coffee-based cocktail that was amazing. It saved the meal for my taste buds.The service was fine given that it was a very busy night - we got most things promptly and politely. The ambiance was great, being a very handsome restaurant inside, and the outdoor seating that overlooks the Strip and Bellagio's lake seemed brilliant as well, though we dined inside.For the price, I don't think this place is worth going back to, unless I get a recommendation for a particular dish that is great. But if you are excited about sitting outside and overlooking the Strip, you might want to give it a try."
611,"Very nice atmosphere, good menu, great service. I would go here again, the scallops were delicious and the pear dessert was scruptous!"
612,"Glenn actually found this place with Cole one morning and it has become a family time to go eat.  Breakfast has huge, fresh crepes, which we always get the lemon one.  The eggs benedict with salmon is delicious as well!  Lunchtime, I had ordered the warm olives jar and it comes exactly that.  In a mason jar, a variety of olives that has been warmed and tossed with garlic, olive oil, rosemary and lemon, so so so good!  I have yet to have a bad meal there, service is A+, they come and refill your water without you needing to ask and very polite.  Plus if you sit outside, what a view!  If the weather is a bit too warm, you can still sit in the atrium sun room that still gives you a great view of outside without the heat, or the chill if it's cold outside."
613,"Filet mignon medium. After one bite I can sell my food soul to the steak gods.  Twice I've been here to this upscale, simple restaurant, and I reserved the café seating which is the section between outdoor patio and dining hall. So I got to enjoy the Fountain shows from belaggio. I think it's the optimal seating area- you have to reserve. Because you're not exactly barricaded in a room with no view and you're not outside, either within a foot away from drunk tourists. -unless you smoke. I tried the fish. amazingly prepared.  This is one of my fave steak spots. Go with a date or with your friends. It's promising."
614,"Had a great time here. I ordered the French onion soup because I heard it was great. Normally I don't like French onion soup and while I didn't love it I liked it more than any other I'd ever had before. For dinner I had steak frites au poivre with a glass of Beaujolais. The pairing worked well and the food was tasty. The steak was cooked just as I had ordered it, and despite being pounded VERY thin (something I usually don't like) it was actually very well done (medium rare but prepared like I want it). The frites were quite good as well and there were a ton of them. The coolest part is that you can sit out on the patio and watch the Bellagio fountains. Cool atmosphere. Good food. If you can get on the patio do it."
615,"On a busy Friday night during Veteran's Day weekend, we prayed that Mon Ami Gabi would not be fully reserved. Upon waiting in the line that took a good 5 minutes to get to the woman at the counter, I realized how popular this restaurant really was among tourists/regular visitors alike. Why? Well from my experience, the prices are incredibly reasonable and the food is delicious. But anyways.The woman up front said it would be a 30-45 minute wait, which was great considering the place was flooded and seemed as packed as the metro during rush hour. She then handed us the vibrating 'thing'.While we waited, we went to one of Paris's small pastry shops and talked and drank some teas. After only about.. eh.. 25 minutes? I was worried that being a little far from the restaurant would prompt the vibrating thing not to vibrate, but it! Then again, I was still in the hotel and not really far... but that's happened to me before and subsequently. I lost my table. ANYWAYS.The atmosphere? Well it was still busy when we being seated, but not as busy at it was during 7:30-8. It was already about 8:30-9 when we got seated. I loved the lighting. Pretty dark, but romantic and authentic. We got seated inside (outside was packed.. clearly), and were right next to the wine cellar. Waiter and waitress would go in and out of it, but they never bumped into our table, so that was good. It was pretty loud, but still manageable to talk to one another. The bread & butter? This is always an important one for me. The bread came in a Mon Ami Gabi bag and was a small baguette, perfect for my group of 3. We split it and the butter was DELISH. I think it had something extra in it. Maybe honey? I don't know but it was great. The bread was hot and soft and amazing. The food?I got the Fish and Frites and my friends got the trout and the steak with caramalized onions and a wine sauce... I think. We also ordered a side of garlic spinish which was DELISHH and I'm not that crazy about spinish. My Fish and Frites was very good. The fish was well cooked and I loved the frites. The fish wasn't too flavorful, but how much more flavorful can fish and chips be? I tried my friends steak and it was literally the best steak I had EVER tasted. And I hate steak.HATE IT.Disgusting.Yuck!BUT THIS. This was something else. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the sauce on it was heavenly. The caramelized onions (which I usually don't like by itself) complemented the dish soo well and it was just amazing. If I had known how good the steak was here, i would have probably gotten it myselfMy other friend's trout was also another testament to this restaurant's amazing food. The trout was soo flavorful and it came with green beens on the side which looked great. The price? For Las Vegas standards, A BARGAIN. my receipt was as follows:water all around1 cosmo for the friend (11 dollars!)Garlic spinish (i think 4 or 4.50)steak fish & fritestrout86 dollars! I was shocked. That's honestly a bargain for LV standards. The area of Mon Ami Gabi is among one of my favorites (just across from Bellagio) and if you manage to get hold of a patio seat, you have a view of Bellagio's water show. All in all, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who goes to Las Vegas. LOVE MON AMI GABI"
616,"For all the crazy that Vegas is, Mon Ami Gabi is a refuge in the storm for us.  It's always there for us with the same quality time after time. For the price, I don't think you can have better food, service or a view in Vegas.  Sit outside on the patio for a ""front row"" view of the Bellagio water show.  It's very fancy, but the waiter's are not stuck up like other places.  Even dressed casually with a kid in tow, the French waiter was happy to discuss and let me try several varieties of wine before settling on a glass.  The wine list is good, and it helps when they waiters are in the know about what they are selling.  The steaks are what keep us coming back.  The top four on the menu are thin and huge.  About a foot long and four inches wide, they span the oval table.  Steaks are served along with awesome thin-cut crispy fries.  Steaks are in the $23 range.  We've been here 3 times now, and there is really nothing bad to say about it.  Highly recommended."
617,"this has got to be one of those ""don't miss"" things in Vegas.  Sitting outside on the strip eating a wonderful breakfast.  My wife and i were there for our anniversary.  We stopped here on our way to city center and we were thrilled!.  The service is great and the food choices plentiful.  We drank cappuccino's, champaign and ate well. i really to recommend this place as a classic Vegas experience."
618,"I opted to not sit in the patio because it was super bright out and I already felt blinded just walking here! I guess that's what happens after drinking all night... Our waiter didn't seem too happy with her job and began to walk away as she was finishing up telling us about the specials. Wow, if you don't want to be here, then don't fucking work here. At least our waters were constantly filled up by another waitress. On to the food...We started off with the French onion soup which was by far the cheesiest French onion soup I've ever eaten. Delicious! I felt full after just sharing it with Joe. Dip some of that crusty bread in there and mm mm mm party in my mouth! I got the croque madam which was really good. I was expecting small portions but it was actually a lot of food! Or maybe French food is so heavy that you think you're eating a lot. The frites were good. They're kind of like thin potato chips. Joe got the crab salad tartine which was not good. I don't recommend it. You can barely taste the crab because everything else stuffed into the crab salad was overwhelming. You can only taste crab if you pick out a little piece of it. I don't think crab cut into tiny little pieces. The potato chips were good though!"
619,Closes thing to being in Paris under the real Effile tower. With your occasional snobby french hostess.Still one of my favorite lunch spots in Vegas. I wished they served Foie Gras during lunch though.
620,"It sure helps making reservations on a Sunday night for a big group.  With 11 of us for dinner, the wait to get us all out on the patio was about 10 minutes.  We would have probably been seated right away at our 9:30 reservation time if we wanted to eat inside.  But why would you?  It was a lovely November night, a little chilly, but clear, and there are plenty of heaters on the patio.  We watched several rounds of the Bellagio fountains across the street, and had a great dinner.If you are worried about it being a ""French Place,"" don't worry, it really is not. They have a variety of pounded steaks (the waiter made several points on this), but they also have some nice, thick traditional cuts.  I had the 22 ounce bone-in rib eye, one of my favorite cuts.  It was quite a hunk of meat, but it was very flavorful and perfectly cooked at my requested medium rare.The wince list is a little pricey, some options in the mid $30s would be nice, but we had a couple of the less expensive Bordeauxs and really enjoyed the meal.  Most of us had starters, and the bread is excellent, as are the pom frittes (that's french fries) that come with the steaks.  An excellent meal, with a great view and good service."
621,"A great spot to sip some wine, have some great food & people watch.   Doesn't hurt that you get front row seats to the Bellagio's water shows as well. The Steak Au Poivre was excellent, the pate was alright.  Definitely a very touristy spot, but what part of Vegas isn't?"
622,"Well... Oohh la Laaa!!! :)This place is great!!!Greeted by a nice lady at the front and was seated quickly. The waitor was nice and pleasant. He went over the wine list with me and seemed very knowledgeable about what they had to offer.Sweeet!!We didn't have any starters, we just ordered dinner.I went for the fish and chips...Now this is odd as this is a more English dish rather than French... Ohh well, odd but I fancied it.... Ohh my THIS WAS THE YUMMIEST BLOODY COD I'VE EVER HAD.... WoooshEveryone else at my table went for the stake so obviousely I had to try some steak from my sister's plate... (hee heee) And yes, the steaks were really tastey and juicy....I really like their chips too... slim and crispy and not too oily... So enjoyed that too...The price was reasonable and we all had a good time here.. Really hope to be back soon... :)"
623,"First tip, sit outside. You will have an awesome view of the Bellagio fountains across the street. It's worth dining at the restaurant for the view itself, but the food will blow you away as well. Our waiter had a fake French accent and was pretty cool to talk to. My mother and I came here for 1 reason... to eat their steak frites. They are to die for, and like I said on my profile, they would definitely be my last meal before I died if I had any say about it. They first gave us some bread. It was a baguette, and it was delicious. I think I could have eaten the entire baguette if I wasn't so anxiously awaiting the steak frites. When the steak finally came, it was cooked perfectly, and the french fries were nice and crisp. I couldn't ask for anything more. The portions were pretty big, so I didn't finish, but I still had some room for dessert.We ordered the bananas foster crepes, and excuse my French, but HOLY SHIT, they were delicious. They were definitely one of the best desserts that I've ever eaten. The crepes were extremely thin and filled with bunches of sliced bananas and this caramel sauce... if you were thinking that this couldn't get any decadent, they were topped with vanilla ice cream. I experienced pure bliss while eating these crepes, and you will too. So yeah, overall if you're looking for moderately priced food on the strip with a good view and an epic dessert, you should definitely try Mon Ami Gabi."
624,"They don't accept reservations for their outdoor seating, so it's first-come, first served.  We came for breakfast early enough that we didn't have to wait.At the server's suggestion, my friend had the HAM AND CHEESE OMELETTE with gruyere cheese.  It was yummy and a good sized portion.  I ordered the GRILLED STEAK AND EGGS.  The steak was flat and about the size of a 4"" x 6"" photo, so it's not too much meat for the a.m.Each of our dishes were served with breakfast potatoes, which were hashbrowns with sauteed onions, and toast.  My friend subbed a croissant for the toast.  The croissant was very hard when she tried to break it apart.  She asked for it to be heated and a fresh one was brought out, but it was still on the hard side.  I really liked their toast -- two slices of thick-cut, rustic white bread.  Both are fantastic with their raspberry jam and butter.The service was great too.  Our server even offered to heat up my friend's dish when he saw that she had stepped away for a call.Definitely my favorite destination for breakfast when I'm in Vegas."
625,"Great food, Awesome location, very good service, sometimes a bit hard to get a table."
626,"I had high hopes of this spot... but it failed miserably after their treatment of my party and I...Since I was still uber full from Aloha Kitchen late lunch meal... friend and I ended up meeting up with my boss and her husband here for dessert and drinks. I made a res to begin with and checking in was  a breeze... now the getting seated part was where it all went horrible.My boss and her husband had dinner there that same night... literally 3 hours after...and before getting seated... we asked for the dessert/drinks menu. The hostess broke down...Hostess: ""uhm you can't have dessert only...""Boss: ""we had dinner here like hours ago... now we're back for dessert and we can't do that?""Hostess: ""uhm let me check (insert her clicking on her radio gadget while totally using her Valley like look and tone of voice...)Friend: ""If I get an entree, would that solve the issue?""Hostess: ""uhm... yah... yes...""GREAT!I looked over at the boss... fuming.When our server finally came... he said it doesn't matter to him what we order as long as we're happy. Hmm... HE SHOULD BE THE HOST!Folks, I understand policy is policy ... really I do. However, if the restaurant is dead... not much folks inside eating... why would you turn away 4 people who wants to dessert and drinks? Why not make money where you can?!Anyway, the rest of the night was a blur. BLAH is more like it.I had chocolate mousse with Parisian Sidecar. Both was EH. The sidecar was probably the most horrible sidecar I've ever had. The mixture itself didn't flow together! The mousse was bland. Overall... EH. The reviews do match up. It's a definite hit or miss... Just be prepared for the Valley (Kendra) looking hostess with their radio gadget... ""UHM...yah...""Thanks but no thanks.PS: No Hanger One... No come back."
627,"I have eaten here a couple of dozen times and they have without a doubt the best steaks in Vegas for the price and other than a long wait to be seated I have never had a bad experience.  This past Friday was no exception.  The ambiance is great and we had a window seat view for the Bellagio water show. Our waiter was fast, professional and overall did a great job. The fresh and hot french bread is served warm in a bag and we asked for an Amuse-bouche of finely cut carrots( reminds me of the carrot salads I have had on the TGV trains in France) The two of us shared the following: The Frisée & Warm Bacon Salad, good not great.    The Hors D'Oeuvres of  Sea Scallops Gratinées with  caramelized fennel and onion marmalade and mussel cream was off the charts.  TheFilet Mignon with  merlot butter, red wine reduction  and thin ribbon cut pom frites delivered in spades, perfectly cooked and very tender, tons of flavor.   If you are staying at Paris this place is a must try. They are generally very busy at night and service and seating can be challenging at times, especially patio seating in the summer months. They do have two small bars where you can eat a full meal off the menu, great for solo people on business travel."
628,"Eat on the patio! Came here and met up with a friend I hadn't seen in years. Food and service were great, lovely view of the Bellagio fountains, and it is just plain cool to eat right on the strip."
629,"Delicious ... great atmosphere ... great service!!! The value? Well, that's relative to what food costs in Las Vegas. I thought it was decent pricing for great food. We went for lunch on Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend. We did not have reservations. We were told the wait would be 15-30 mins but they buzzed us for a table within 5 mins. We were seated outside, near the sidewalk in the front, with a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains (we were able to watch 2 fountain shows while seated). They serve you a mini-baguette while waiting for your meal. I loved it, the hubby didn't love it as much as I did; then again, I'm a breadie. I had the French Onion soup (perfect for the cold day we had - it's not something i'd recommend having in the middle of the day in summer). The Gruyère cheese on top of the soup was YUM! For an entrée I ordered the Macaroni Gratin. It's not Kraft mac-n-cheese. This is adult macaroni with cream, butter, and more Gruyère! I shared this with the hubby who ordered the Steak Frites with the caramelized onioins and red wine sauce. I would've licked this sauce off the floor if the plate was dropped. It's that good! The frites were not pomme frites, which is what I was expecting. They were very small, thinly sliced french fries. Blah when paired with the delicious steak. It needed a heartier side. The frites would've been perfect with a burger. We were not able to order dessert, as we were stuffed. I believe the bill was around $50 for all the food we got. Also, we only had water (hangover nursing) and did not partake in the wine. The wine list was extensive and on a normal day, the wine would've been tested. This is the reason for the low food bill. Will we be returning? YES!!! We will never go to Vegas again without a stop at this lovely restaurant.I do recommend this for adults. I do not recommend this for children. Even though they have a children menu, I think taking your kids will ruin the experience for the other adult patrons. Take your kids to McDonalds or the buffet. Please do not take them to this restaurant!!! Let's leave this place to being intimate and romantic."
630,"I have visited Mon Ami Gabi twice. My girlfriend is gluten-sensitive so the Gluten-Free menu attracted us. I have had a great experience and a poor experience. Both experiences the food was great. The first experience our waiter was extremely nice, helpful and professional. The second experience the waitress was rushed, cold and unorganized. She did seem to have a lot going on, so I didn't hold it against her. This is a great place is you are gluten-free. You cannot beat the great views and the patio is awesome if they weather is nice."
631,"YUMMY!!!nice view, we sat just behind the glasses that are facing the bellagio fountain.the escargot was really good.the filet mignon is good, we love their fries, so unique yet tasty!the bread was delicious!"
632,My first time at a French steakhouse. The filet with merlot butter was amazing! Melts in your mouth. The service was great and the ambiance was nice. I am used to paying a big price for a nice meal in California so I was surprised to see the menu prices here. $32 for and 8 oz filet. Most of their items were around $20-$25 and the quality was above my expectations.
633,"Review of breakfast.  Nice view and location on the Las Vegas Strip for a tourist.  The croissant sandwich was just ok.  A turn-off was the garnish, brownish/expiring frisee.  My friend got the mushroom omelette which was also just ok.  The toast that came with it was burnt.  The service was slow and seemed like our waitress took a break after taking our order.  We had to ask twice of other waiters for water."
634,"Excellent food, very good wine list, attentive service. Also offer a gluten free menu."
635,"My Friend Gabi or Mon Ami Gabi (in case you didn't know what it meant in English, Gabi is short for Gabino the owner/chef) is probably my favorite local steakhouse. I bring all my closest friends here, whether they're local or visiting.  My boyfriend hosted my surprise bday party here too, so they do great with groups.  MAG is always a sure fire hit and it's the kind of place you know will impress and satisfy your guests without seeming overly booshie. While the food is always superb I think the ambiance and location really makes it an instant crowd pleaser, even before we crack the awesome fresh warm baguettes (that keep coming by the way, all you gotta do is ask).  In the evening the lighting is low and romantic with candles at every table.  In the day, the wonderful floor to ceiling window/doors from the patio let wonderful natural light in.  The key selling point is the patio seating that gives u a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.  You can't reserve patio seating though so you can try to reserve a table in the atrium that sometimes gives just as good as a view :) Now for the food!My must order every visit is the Fliet Mingon with Merlot Butter and the Steamed Mussels for an appetizer.  My first couple times I've tried some other steak variations and sauces but my heart belongs to the filet! :) I order it medium and it's just melt in your mouth ""Mmmmm"" after every bite good.  Steaks can be prepared anyway you like. They have set pairings like a certain cut with a certain sauce however, you can pair any sauce with any cut of meat just ask :) Oh and every steak comes with frites (or awesome French fries)! The steamed mussels are my absolute favorite the sauce they come in is a classic white wine with leeks and bacon but done to perfection!  Make sure you dip your warm French bread in the sauce it's delicious! Lunch is also a good option here because they serve great specials not normally on the menu.  The last time I went to lunch and brought my cousin's bachelorettes/bridal party here and the steak sandwich was sooo delicious! My sister ordered it and I ended up eating half  of it and my filet (yes I still ordered my filet at lunch...it's that good)!So if you're looking for an awesome casual steak place on the strip that really gives you or your guests that ""I'm in Las Vegas"" feel give Mon Ami Gabi a try, you won't be sorry."
636,"I guess the French chefs at Mon Ami Gabi don't know how to make turkey! (Nor filet mignon)We went there for Thanksgiving. They had a prix fixe menu for the occasion that comes with all the standard Thanksgiving items (turkey, yam, stuffing, gravy, etc), as well as the rest of the menu they usually have. My wife ordered the prix fixe, and found the turkey to be so salty that it was uneatable, on top of being over cooked around the edges. The gravy itself was also very salty. The only thing good on the menu was the yam, which ended up being her entire dinner. We were in a rush to catch a show, so we didn't have time to ask the chef to re-make it or bring out something else, although I'm sure for Thanksgiving, the turkey is already made in batches, and probably over-brined, which means they couldn't make it less salty if they wanted to at that point. I myself ordered the filet mignon off of their regular menu. The filet itself was just ok, also quite salty, although still eatable. However, it makes you wonder why we're paying these prices if I can grill a better filet at home myself. The sides on the plate around the filet was simply a huge portion of fried shredded curly potatoes, that had no taste, but full of grease. It was all over the plate around the filet, all curly, looking like pubic hair... absolutely not appetizing. I have been to many many French restaurants. Some more expensive, some less, so I feel like I have a good idea of what level of food goes with the level of price. For the level of quality at Mon Ami Gabi, I would have to say the food is far from being able to justify the price."
637,"Charming resturant that looks like it would be heavily overpriced. Been here twice now and really enoued the onion soup, they are not stingey on the gruyer cheese! Endive and pear salad was a bit salty for my taste but there's plenty more to choose from. Baugettes were real tasty!"
638,Great food. Had the filet with merlot butter. Excellent steak with good frittes. Recommended strongly.
639,"Mon Ami Gabi sits right on the strip and you can either sit outside and people watch or inside and stay cool. I highly recommend the people watching section. I specifically came here for Saturday brunch to get the corned beef hash. I had really high hopes for it, but it just didn't do anything for me. They had huge chunks of dry and chewy corned beef barely mixed in with potatoes. The poached eggs were perfect, and the hash browns were crisp just the way I like it. I would still recommend this place because it sits right across the Bellagio Fountains and you get a great show.www.anitaeat.com"
640,"I discovered Mon Ami Gabi Restaurant during my last visit to Vegas. I was so impressed. that during this trip, I made it a point to reserve a spot at this classic French Bistro. I think the family agrees that this was an unforgettable experience. A bagged baguette. is placed on the table and our Caesar salads were served. We all ordered the Steak FritesThe steaks are listed as ""steak"" No particular cut. Just steak. Nice tender steak. And the French fries were perfectly done.  Steaks around the table were, Steak Roquefort, Steak Au Poivre, and Steak Bearnaise.   With so many steak houses in Vegas it surprised me that,.. in a very French way, this place stands on it's own. The grain-fed Midwest beef is undoubtedly the best beef I've had in a long time. The service is friendly, efficient, and not snooty in any way. If you find yourself in Las Vegas make it a point to visit Mon Ami Gabi. During the summer months, sit out side, under the misters and watch the water show across the street at the Bellagio. It's a perfect romantic setting.   Things to rememberNo matter how close, a Hotel looks...it's not. It's all an illusionCab everywhereThe winter months are frigging cold, take a coat"
641,"Meeting up with friends for lunch, we stopped at Mon Ami Gabi Restaurant as it was close to another stop we were making. The other 4 were already there (coming from the Venetian) and I was on foot coming way down from the Luxor. Needless to say, I was holding up the crowd. The rest of the party could not be seated or put their name on the list until I arrived as well. When I finally did arrive, we were seated outside on the patio - which was a plus. Nice weather, good views - but the table was very small. Too small to crowd 5 people around. Inevitably, there was frequent bumping from people walking by on their way to and from their tables. I thought the service was a bit lower than expected. One guy came out to give everyone water. He filled up everyone's glass and when it came to mine there was only enough for 1/3 of a glass. Did he get more? No. So I drank it thinking it would be a sign to bring more - but it wasn't. We did receive two sleeves of baguettes. One saucer was filled with the olive oil for dinner and there were four other saucers for people to put their bread - except there were five of us. I had to eventually stop someone and ask for a plate. Looking over the menu I selected the Caesar salad. When everyone's plate was brought out everything looked so good. Another guy at our table ordered another kind of salad and it was huge - then mine came out. It was one of the smallest, most boring things I have seen ever: a few strips of lettuce, some cheese and a shard of bread - all for the nice price of $9. I could definitely do without a repeat visit here."
642,"This place is AWESOME! You definitely have to sit outside. The outside seating is right along the strip, across from the Bellagio- as you will have a perfect view of the water show while you have lunch or dinner.The french onion soup was extremely good. The Steak Bordelaise was AMAZING. Portions are not shy. I split this tasty steak with the bf.I will definitely eat here again :)"
643,"Had a lovely brunch here after a long night and it was delightful! Sat on the patio (a must on a warm day) and had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains. That alone made the meal worth it.The food was tasty, though nothing in particular stood out, maybe because the morning was a bit of a blur. I enjoyed the french onion soup and the waffles (or was it french toast?) were yummy as well.If it's a hot day and you do sit outside, be prepared for many a passerby to stop and put their faces next to you while they try and enjoy the mist spraying along the fence of the patio."
644,"One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas!I usually stop in for brunch, but this last trip we came in for dinner. We had no reservations but were seated quickly. Our server was knowledgable, friendly and attentive.Food is excellent overall! For dinner I ordered the Steak Béarnaise with frites and husband ordered the special of the night: Arctic Char over brussel sprouts and some bacon. Cleaned both our plates! (Note: I've also had a burger/fries and french toast there -- L.O.V.E the french toast.)We came back for dessert later in the night with a couple friends. The hostess that sat us was kind of snotty and said that their tables are only for full dining after we told her that we had dinner earlier and were joining our friends for dessert and drinks. Our waiter couldn't care less what we ordered as long as we were happy.For dessert, I had the Profiterole Trio and the rest of the table ordered the Bread Pudding (it's a special and not on the regular menu) and the Chocolate Mousse. My profiteroles could've been better -- I was expecting a cream filling and not ice cream, but that's what i get for not paying close attention. I should've jumped on the bandwagon and got the bread pudding instead. I didn't try the chocolate mousse, but it's chocolate and I'm sure you can't go wrong with that either.The specialty drinks were so-so. Pricey for what it is. Instead, order your favorite drink from the full bar and it won't cost you $12.95 in disappointment.Their prices are reasonable and the food is excellent. Check it out the next time your in Vegas!"
645,"My GOD I love this restaurant.I try and eat at Mon Ami Gabi every time I visit Las Vegas. The food is incredible and the view of the Bellagio fountains is unbelievable.It's a French-style Steakhouse -- which to me means, super thin, tender (almost like flank steak) served with pomme frittes (super thin, crispy fried potatoes). They give you the option of sauces to drizzle over your steak...two of my favorites are the red wine and the béarnaise. Totally, completely delicious!"
646,"one of my favorite favorite restaurants in vegas!!!! not only is the food amazing but the view is an added bonus!!!! this place never disappoints.they have the same kitchen as the eiffel tower restaurant upstairs so you are basically getting the same food but for less! i recommend sitting on the patio for some good people watching and it is right across the bellagio water show so u can enjoy the show and food at the same time.their steaks are pretty amazing... cut thin, perfectly cooked and seasoned. the red wine reduction sauce is to die for.. i also have tried their filet mignon, im not a big fan of super thick cut steaks but i really enjoyed theirs. thier pomme frittes were perfect as well. the price range is actually very reasonable. the food here never disappoints and it doesnt have all the superficial trimmings of a fancy vegas-y restaurant. just honest to goodness straight forward good food. a must see here in vegas."
647,Great little resturaunt right outside the Paris Hotel with a nice view. We had breakfast and the service and food was great.
648,"Came here last year in September for my 21st bday wknd with my boyfriend. Had lunch here before leaving for the airport for our flight. Forgot what we ordered, but whatever it was- it was pretty great. We sat outside so we had a lovely view of the Bellagio. Service was good. I think this was the first time I tried escargot."
649,"YUM! YUM! YUM!Saw so many great reviews about this here that we simply HAD to try it!  We came for breakfast and sat on the patio.  It was about 15 degrees C out but the heaters they had on were sooooo warm we had to ask them to turn it down!I had the croissant w/chicken, avocado and tomato?  It was very yums!  I particularly liked the frise salad that was served on the side.  I also had the mimosa ($9.95) that was very delicious!  Not too much orange juice (would like to try the raspberry one next time).  Hubby had the ham and cheese (gruyere) omelette served with hash and toast (baguette slices).  The omelette was fluffy and moist.  Hubby scarfed down the hash so quickly I didn't have the chance to taste :PAltogether our meal came to about $36.  Had it not been for our fascination for buffets and our crazy spending - we'd probably go again for dinner."
650,"Very, very good although a bit pricey.I had the ""skinny"" apple pancakes and Eggs Benedict, and both were incredible.  My waitress was a complete doll too.  I'd go back any day."
651,"Had a very romantic birthday dinner here last year... wonderful food and even better wine! A little crowded... and we had to wait 45 minutes after our reservation time for a seat... hence the 4 star, not the 5... Attentive wait staff. Would love to return again sometime!"
652,"Great restaurant!!! We had dinner for about $60 for two. The Steak Roquefort fritte was perfect.  Onion soup is also one of the best i've had.  Wife had the Lemon chicken which was also very good. If your looking for a 24oz portherhouse, your at the wrong place, but you will not be disapointed with the qualty and flavor."
653,"Last night in Vegas and our friends and I weren't too hungry.  I've read about this place and wanted to try it and since we were walking by on our way to Caesars, we decided to eat here.  Was planning on just getting the french onion soup since it was a little cold outside and I love french onion soup.  We requested a table for 5 outside since it was nice and we could watch the Bellagio fountains while we hung out.  The mini baguette that they brought out to eat while we wait for our food was pretty good.  Crusty and chewy, just like I like it.  Like I said, I was planning on the french onion soup but when I heard that one of the specials was bouillabaisse, that's what I wanted.  I like seafood.  It was cold outside.  Perfect.  Soup was very flavorful and fresh.  The mussels and clams were tender and sweet.  The fish was perfect.  Not mushy but just firm enough.  And last but not least were the scallops.  Nice, big and sweet.  Not tough but tender.  And to top it off, some really crusty bread slices to sop up the liquids.  Trust me, you want to get all of it.  I also shared the chicken liver mousse with my buddy.  That was delicious.  Put that on the toasted points and it was a homerun.  Put a little of their mustard on it and it's a whole different experience but still a winner.  The service was solid.  The atmosphere was fun and not boring or stuffy.  I would definitely eat here again next time I'm in Vegas."
654,"Pros:* Conveniently located at Paris Hotel & Casino's front entrance.* Nice atmosphere. I like how they have big round tables for parties of 10 or more inside. Patio seatings are REALLY nice. You can get a clear view of the strip, especially Fountain of Bellagio right across the street.* Very friendly waitress.Cons:* Reception girl didn't really show her side of hospitality and smile since she's very busy taking calls.* BAD FOOD THAT'S NOT WORTH THE PRICE. I think the only reason anyone would come to a decent restaurant other than the upscale atmosphere and service is the food. They kinda failed. We ordered 4 steaks averaging about $30+ each. My friend's New York was overcooked. My prime rib was good in texture but wasn't even warm. We asked for replacement. This time, the New York was cooked right but has way too many tendons in it. My prime rib was warm but the texture was really bad.Final verdict: Been there, done that, WON'T do it again."
655,"This place is Great.  Well, hostesses there is usually young rude girls who know nothing about service.  I've been here four times, and each time, it's the same cold, fast, rude hostess service.However, once you sit down, the food is excellent and wait staff is experienced.  I've been to Vegas 100's of times and this is my second favorite restaurant on the Strip.  A must if you are new to Vegas.**** Been there recently and it was horrible service."
656,"I chose Mon Ami Gabi, because of its Yelp rating and proximity to my hotel. I was not disappointed, and neither were any of my friends.The food was excellent, though a little pricey considering it was lunch fare. I had a chicken sandwich with Brie, and apple slices. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I was actually hoping for brunch, which unfortunately they only serve on Sundays, but I left completely satisfied with my second choice. My only culinary complaint is with their 'french fries' which are super thin cut and crispy like chips. They totally suck.The service was great, the Bloody Marries were excellent, and the atmosphere was inviting and unique."
657,"One fact that hit me when I was in Vegas is that they simply do not have enough polished people to work the restaurants and hotels in the city.  When I was in Todd English's PUB there were a number of overweight unattractive middle aged men dressed in jeans and tight shirts and the hostess had a tramp stamp clearly visible on her lower back.On Mon Ami Gabi, my waitress looked like someone more at home at a blue plate special diner than an upscale strip restaurant and the busboy clearly was an ""amateur"".   When someone in my party asked him what the Soup of the Day was he said, ""I don't know, I am the busboy"",...really good answer.The place itself is nice and most people choose to dine al fresco as it is perhaps the best place to people watch on the Strip.  I ordered the Mac & Cheese which was a disappointment as it has no bread crumbs on top and the flavor was sorely lacking.  Not a bad place but not a great place....good for a one-time visit."
658,"Can I be lame and say I went to Paris for brunch? I don't have to specify which Paris I'm referring to ;). My girls and I were mad craving for breakfast food after a night of shenanigans we'd very much like to drown in some strong coffee and greasy eggs. It was between Mon Ami Gabi or Hash House A Go Go but we were still feeling pretty fancy so we chose Mon Ami instead.  Prices are average for French brunch, anywhere between $8-$15 for an entree. I ordered the eggs benedict, one friend ordered the soup of the day, and the other two ordered blueberry french toast. It's well known the French love their food in modest portions so we went in very such expectations. Color us surprised when our plates came out and the portions were NOT so modest. I'm fairly certain a French person would've scoffed at the sight but wow, for $14 I got 2 eggs benedicts and a huge hash brown (I was very delighted since I had been craving for hash browns all night). $11 gets you 3 huge pieces of blueberry french toast with house whipped cream. And I forget how much the soup du jour was, guessing between $7-$9. Everything came out very fast, which pleased us greatly since we were STARVING. Food was excellent. The blueberry french toast was absolutely delicious, no need for syrup whatsoever. Probably the best french toast I've ever had. Needless to say, we couldn't finish the food completely. I don't think any of us anticipated how much we would be getting. Regardless, it was a lovely experience overall. I'm sure they make their Parisian forefathers very proud. P.S. Cannot begin to boast about the GORGEOUS view of the Bellagio water fountains. Brunch AND a show!"
659,"The group I was with wasn't really in the mood for a buffet, and chose Mon Ami Gabi instead. Though our pockets/wallets suffered a bit, our hearts and stomachs surely didn't.First of all, I had the Frangria at the bar - a French twist on the Spanish classic and it was quite delish. We were then served piping hot bread with butter, and I ordered the Steak frites a la bernaise (yum!!!). I had the meat medium rare (which was delivered perfectly). Fries were not your normal American steak fries, but thin slivers of potatoes (a la francaise).The only thing that bothered me was the fact that our waitress pronounced ""gratin"" in a very thick, American accent. I don't mean to be too posh about this, but if you work in a French restaurant in Paris (granted you are still in Vegas - but still!) you should be able to pronounce some things in a slight French accent.Nonetheless, my compliments go out to the chef!"
660,"In my opinion the food was good, the venue was excellent, and the service was below par.  A poor testimony to mandatory gratuities.Don't get me wrong, the food here is above average and within our party of 5, nobody complained about the food.  I had Eggs Benedict and they were very good.  And, I just don't think you can complain about the venue; it is in a fantastic location and well maintained.  We've eaten here twice now & both of those things have been consistent.  And, for the location & quality of food, the price point is fair.Ahh, but there is a catch.  Their service is poor.  The girls up front must be the manager's daughter's friends or something.  I stood there for over 5 minutes after our initial conversation before I got a response & then, only after I asked (for the 2nd time) where my party was going to be seated - and during that time, the only person to even come to the station was a person on the way out to make a quick comment.  I was early and on a mid-week day, so there wasn't a lot of traffic.Turns out, they don't open the patio until about 9 am.  So the little girls at the front, had me sit at an inside table (even though I requested a patio table & was told it was 1st come / 1st serve & I was there at 8:45 & I told them the rest of my party would not be there until at or after 9 am).When everyone arrived at about 9:05, they asked if we could sit outside, so I asked the bartender who to ask about that & he pointed me to the floor manager who arranged it.  This, of course was an unnecessary move, but whatever.  I left a good tip for the waitress who had served me coffee (only) and moved to the patio table.Later, after I received my meal, I asked my waitress for a condiment & she seemed pleased to get it.  Later, when it had not arrived and my meal was getting cold, I reminded her again & she acknowledged that she had forgotten.  Yeah, I never got that condiment.When I got the bill, an 18% gratuity was added to the bill.  Now, a couple of comments on that.  1st - the waitress told me the bill included the gratuity & that was fair of her - i've had that before, of course, but I do feel like they're trying to see if you're paying attention if they don't disclose it.  2nd - 18% is less than I typically tip for good service - but in this case, I would have tipped less, our server didn't deserve more, for sure & since I assume they share tips with the greeters, it surely would have been less.So, in my opinion the food was good, the venue was excellent, and the service was below par."
661,"I LOVE random trips to Las Vegas and this is probably my 3rd one???Anyways....came here with a friend for a late lunch since we were out the entire night before. We walked from the Monte Carlo to Paris and I have to state that it was one of the best walks ever. :) I haven't really cavorted the strip like that and I felt I was young again...what am I saying, I'm not even that old!We were seated within 3-5 minutes of getting into the restaurant. Everyone has to wait in the bar area for a table. Finally, our host took us to our table outdoors. The view is spectacular. Just as we sat down, the fountain show at the Bellagio commenced. It would've been the most ideal late lunch ever,  but it ended up raining and we has to take a booth inside. boo hiss argh.The booths are comfy and it's dim inside, which makes the setting very romantic. there's the more lit area where I'd hang with my friends, then the outdoor patio if I wanted some air.I ordered the brie, green apple and chicken sandwich which was not what i expected. I consider myself a huge BRIE and APPLE fanatic...but this one was bland...barely any chicken in my sandwich and it was dry! The soup du jour, which was a cream mash potato mussel soup was DELICIOUS! I almost ate it all with the baguette they give you. The baguette was a little burnt at the bottom, but did not taste bad. I also ordered a bloody mary with extra horseradish...it was ok. Best bloody mary I have had was at Bear Mountains hands down, but I'll try anything once.My friend ordered the croque monsieur but instead they gave him a croque madame, which we didn't realize until the bill came out. At that moment he exclaimed why his meal didn't look right. It was missing the creamy sauce on top.All in all, I mayyy come back here to try their make your own bloody marys. As for the food, I was not impressed. We will see how the make your own bloody marys fare in Feb 2011!"
662,"It is an oasis on the ""strip"". Great and varied menu. Highly recommend Mon Ami Gabi. Classy but relaxed, consistent and just a great place. It helps my mental health to confirm my observations and simulate my sense of humor by reading other reviews by world class esteemed reviewers:  LOL such reviews... and I quote:  ""I went for the fish and chips....""   This is odd as it is more an English dish rather than French. and another quote:  ""what is a ""bloody cod? sounds kinda nasty"". Who would order ""fried cod"" ata French Bistro?Anyhooo, one of the great joints on the ""strip"". Food, Service, Location deserves the 5 stars, but cannot hand those ratings out with impunity.Summer Time (oh, there is a song by that title) it is GREAT to sit outside and watch the world go by (the 1st, 2nd and 3rd world), Winter Time (no song title) inside is a bit dark but elegant (ok, some consider this romantic), and a bit crowded. Food & service are always excellent.  Another ""touch stone"" in LV."
663,"What is French for ""OMG I would totally go back there, that place was so yummy""...well, it slipped my mind. Still. I loved this place. Having never been before a girlfriend of mine and I decided to go here for dinner before seeing the Nutcracker. We ate inside since it was cool out but the views of Bellagio fountains was AWESOME! The atmosphere was beautiful and very romantic. Dimmed lights, fancy table settings, attentive wait staff. The food was incredible as well. Of course to start we had escargot (one each), YUM! I had the seared sea scallops with whipped cauliflower. It was delicious. To end I had the creme brule. It was really tasty as well.  Not to mention the sour dough bread and butter that came. The meal was really good.I would definitely go back here again....good food, good service, good view and good friends. (Ok, the last one you will have to get your own on)J'adore! (French for LOVE people)"
664,"Me: Is that the line for Le Buffet?He: YepNot willing to wait in a long ass line for buffet food, even though this city is where buffets are the norm, we walked up to the front and decided to eat lunch here.  Christmas is just a day around these parts, so the inside wasn't crowded.  We opted for the patio and got a street side table where we could see the water show at Bellagio.Bottle of Cotes du Rhone - checksmall loaf of hot bread - checkFeels like we're in Paris without the long ass plane ride.  The only difference is, although it's not so obvious, they do want to turn the table.The crispy crab cake appetizer came with a jicama and cucumber slaw.  It was good, but could have used a little less breading.  The specials sounded great and I first ordered the sandwich, but the partner ordered the steak frites with the brandy peppercorn sauce because there were three to choose from.  Looking over the menu again, there was a caramelized onion and red wine sauce....SOLD!  The steaks were cooked to order, a little tough, but good.  The partner said he expected more peppercorns.The frites were interesting.  More like large potato shreds fried crispy, so sort of like a cross between a fry and a chip.  I thought a little more arugula on the plate would've been nice.  We enjoyed our meal so much, we came back for dinner a couple days later.  We pretty much ordered the same.Except, I had the filet mignon with merlot butter,  and the partner had the caramelized onions.  We shared a butter lettuce and crispy apple salad.  This also came with grilled beets and goat cheese, and was very tasty.  And then our over indulgence kicked in and we had the chocolate mousse, creme brulee, and a trio of ice cream in pastry.  So a buffet of desserts...LOL!The service was great!  Attentive and friendly.  The view of the street is by far the best part.  Watching all walks of life going by was interesting.  It may not be the real Paris, but it's close enough and cheaper to get to."
665,"This is really the best place for a great steak and atmosphere for the money.  If you sit outside, you get a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountains.  The filet is amazing, drinks are great.  My favorite is the rib eye with Bearnaise sauce.  Great place to hang out with friends or a nice date."
666,"Was a big fan of the lincoln park location in chicago, so to find the same menu, at similar prices with al fresco dining overlooking the bellagio fountains was a nice treat.The service was super fast, and the warm brie was superb."
667,"Great atmosphere, excellent service, oh yeah and the food was really good too! Our dinner started with a warm baguette served in a paper bag along with a celery root confitte, compliments of the Chef. A nice touch. The roasted chestnut soup, creamed cauliflower and seared scallops were real standouts. The only suggestion I have for those who want to make their dinner a long leisurely experience, would be to tell their waiter up front. They don't at all rush you here, they just seem to know what they are doing and thus are very efficient. Next time in Vegas we will definitely plan to stop here for another dinner."
668,"I don't know what it is about this place. I always want to dine here when I'm in Vegas. I have relatively no desire to dine at its sister restaurants in Reston and Bethesda. They pale in comparison to Vegas. The service here is always phenomenal, the food stellar. They have a varied wine list, but their ""frangria"" (sangria) is what brings us here. Yes, not the steaks. The sangria. Most places either add too much wine (a rare instance but not necessarily a bad thing), too much fruit/juice, or water it down with ice. This french bistro chain gets it right, the perfect ratio with fresh sprigs of rosemary to give it that je ne sais quoi. They've raised the price of the sangria to $19, but it's still reasonably priced compared to wine by the glass or half-bottle.For an appetizer, I ordered the roasted sweet potato soup. This is one of those entrees with a pretentious presentation, but Mon Ami Gabi tones it down a touch. My server sets an average-sized bowl at the table and has a tea kettle that dispenses my soup. It's then garnished with a toasted orange meringue. My friend went simple and decided to get the handmade potato chips with dip. The chips were ridged, crispy and not greasy, and tasted great with my soup.Their steaks are too thin for me, and I am not a fan of their steak frites. The filet mignon is good but I didn't want to spend too much on dinner, so I got the Seared Sea Scallops with spinach, whipped cauliflower, and brown butter. Four fat diver scallops, cooked to perfection, drizzled with brown butter and garnished with parsley. Add some lemon juice and it was divine. My friend ordered Beef Bourguignon (slow braised in red wine, buttered noodles, bacon, mushrooms). She really couldn't taste the bacon but the beef was very tender. She is a big fan of short ribs so this dish was right up her alley.We were too full to get dessert and later wandered into Paris to gamble and I won $6 from the penny slots! We have never had an issue walking in without reservations but we generally go to dinner earlier in the night and we're just a party of two. I would recommend reservations for larger parties. All in all, a good night, and we'll certainly be back."
669,"Ambiance for days, between the well done realistic Paris bistro, dark and cozy inside, bright and lovely in sunroom, outside has the best people watching view and the fountain show across the street at the bilaggio is breathtaking! food has always been good, my eggs Benidict were perfect! Sundays they have an amazing bloody Mary bar! I've been there four times, I guess I like it!"
670,"This is one of my favorite places to eat on the strip...actually in the entire valley (it's a toss up between Eiffel Tower and here).  The wait can be longer for a seat on the patio, but it's soooo worth it. The view of the Bellagio fountains and the people watching can't be beat.  My favorite dish is the Seafood Crepe...scallops, shrimp, peas and cream.  Pair that with a glass of their Pinot Noir or Merlot and the french bread they bring to the table....pure heaven.  I've had their pan-seared cod special and it was light, flavorful and I wish it were a staple on the menu.  Really, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!"
671,"I remember liking this restaurant the first time I went there years ago. This time we went on a busy night but had reservations. We went right in. There were lots of people and I found service to be fast and good considering the amount of people there. My fiance's steak was Ok not good but not horribly bad. I would def. not order that again. My scallops were good-but would not really say it's worth the money. The french onion soup was very good. Overall they have a nice view, good service, overpriced (but expected on the strip), portion size is decent, but food is nothing special. I don't think I will be going back."
672,"We had heard of Mon Ami Gabi, and finally had a chance to go there on our latest trip to Las Vegas.  Great food and great location across the street from the Bellagio fountains.  We were in a party of six and everyone loved their meal.   The escargot appetizer was excellent.  I had the fish special, Pacific cod, which was perfectly prepared.  My wife had the lamb, which was superb."
673,"okay, it might not be the best french inspired restaurant around but it offers some of the best views of bellagio and has the shorted wait time for a table than any other restaurant inside the Paris hotel. the mussels are averagethe prime sandwich is averagethe crab salad sandwich was fairbut the scallops are AWESOME. for you cocktail lovers, they also have a great cocktail menu to sip on while enjoying the fountain show at the bellagio."
674,"Mon Ami Gabi wasn't originally part of the plan during our 3 day Vegas jaunt. However, in killing time before meeting friends at the Palms our tummies let us know it was time to get some pre-drinking eats in. And lo and behold Mon Ami Gabi appeared out of the corner of the Paris Hotel & Casino lobby like a mirage. (Actually my buddy has been raving about this place since our arrival, but her sales pitch couldn't deter us away from other eateries such as N9NE.)We arrived shortly after 10pm and was seated right away. We were offered our choice of indoor or outdoor sitting, but since it was Dec 28, we opted for inside and got a great view of the Bellagio.Being our 2nd meal of the evening we ordered two appetizers and a glass of Rose and MAG's very own Pinot Noir (pretty damn good). The chicken liver mousse was good, especially when paired with the 'burgundy red wine mustard' which seemed to be regular Dijon mustard with a hint of red wine. My only issue with this dish is the pate to toast ratio. The pate slab was very generous compared to the accompanying 4 toast wedges. The frisée salad was what I was waiting for and was disappointed when the server came back to tell us they were all out of frisée. I didn't want any of the other salads on the menu so I asked him if they can substitute the frisee with arugula, endive or even mixed greens (something similar in nuttiness). When the dish arrived the croutons, bacon bits and poached egg were sitting a-top a mountain of romaine!!Boo-hoo sadness!!!  But after a bite, the disappointment was gone. The dish was delicious and I just may ask to have the salad made with romaine for future visits. All in all a great dining experience. The Pinot was great, as with the savory food coupled with great company and the extraordinary view of the strip and the Bellagio fountains.  And might I add, a better dining experience than N9NE."
675,"4 stars for breakfast.  Had mushroom & Brie omelet and blueberry waffle. First of all, outdoor seating is awesome w the view of Bellagio fountain and for people watching. Friendly service, good coffee, fluffy omelet, and crispy light waffle w plenty of blueberry w sweet airy whip cream- one of the best waffles ever!  FYI, on weekdays breakfast is only served till 11am."
676,"We've eaten here twice while visiting Vegas.  This last time was within the past week.  We made reservations for lunch and were seated outside.  The waitress was friendly and attentive.  We ordered the country pate plate for an appetizer and I ordered a quiche while my husband ordered a sandwich.  I enjoyed the quiche but thought the sandwich was lacking a bit...then again I'm not a huge sandwich fan.  Anyhow the bread and butter is always yummy and I do recommend the quiche which was delicious.  The pate was okay but I didn't know that the country pate was more on the chunkier side, so if you like a more mousse like pate then maybe try the chicken liver one."
677,"TOTAL TOURIST TRAP!!! NYE 2010 Dinner  (Wasted over $400 here on NYE 2010 prix fixe menu. )Worst NY Strip and Filet Mignon ever!!! NO Taste and RubberyNY Steak ordered Medium Rare and  served medium well :-(. Filet ordered Medium and servedMedium Rare :-(. Terrible excuse for Pom Frittes.  Salad had one barely recognizable bite of goat cheese, but was good as was the oysters appetizer. The Creme Brûlée was OK and the coffee excellent. ""Cocktail Hour"" was missing cocktails and only served sparkling wine. FAIL!!! $120 for cheap sparkling wine and OK appetizers. At least the view of the strip was nice and wait staff was attentive.The dinner was awful. We were sandwiched between two other tables elbows almost brushing our neighbors, hardly romantic or nice for $110 per person NYE dinner. There were many empty tables and sections available yet we were sandwiched between other tables like sardines. Although the servers were nice they never asked us if our meal was ok and they couldn't infer by the barely eaten plates that something was awry. The NY Strip was served 2 temperatures overcooked. My girlfriend's salad was taken away before she was finished because there was no room on the table for an extra plate and they brought our Main Course out to us before we finished our salads. Absolutely awful experience. You should have seen the sight of everyone who ordered the steaks sawing away at the rubbery excuse for steak. I kept wondering if it was MUTTON!!!!"
678,"From Wikipedia, ""Snail is a common name for almost all members of the molluscan class Gastropoda that have coiled shells in the adult stage. When the word is used in a general sense, it includes sea snails, land snails and freshwater snails. Otherwise snail-like creatures that lack a shell (or have only a very small one) are called slugs.""Snails, or in the case of Mon Ami Gabi, escargot were NEVER something I thought I'd let cross my lips... until after a few too many mimosas, I got teased into ordering them here.They were, in a single word, outstanding.  (I do suppose, however, that anything is superb when prepared with enough butter and garlic.)  The rest of my brunch here was also spectacular but it paled in comparison to my experience trying snail.Like everyone else said:  beautiful views of the Bellagio fountains, etc.I will certainly return here many times."
679,"3.5...We made reservations for 8p but after a long day out on the Strip, we pushed it back to 9p.Arrived and we were asked whether we still wanted to sit inside or out on the patio. Since I knew the Bellagio Fountains' show began at 9p, we opted for the patio. The patio had heaters, which was awesome since I had a sleeveless dress on. We lucked out and got a table smack dab in the middle of the patio with prime views of the Bellagio and a wonderful view of the Eiffel Tower. It was AMAZING!!!The service from Marlon was great! Recommendations were made and questions answered. -Couple glasses of house Pinots ($15)-Filet ($32)-Hanger Steak ($20)-Special Bread Pudding ($9)Total was $82, plus a generous tip.Steak frites accompanied the steaks and they were yum! I had the filet, and I have to admit, I had to struggle a bit for a clean cut. The hanger had really good seasoning and flavor. When I order dessert, it HAS to be with some type of chocolate. HOWEVER, since the bread pudding was seasonal, we opted to be different and try it. It was warm goodness!!! I would have probably requested a side of hot fudge, but oh well.The service and ambiance truly deserves a 5 star rating. Unfortunately, I expected more with my steak. Would love to come back and try their fresh fish."
680,"I am thoroughly impressed with Mon Ami Gabi! C'est tres bon! It is a incredibly nice restaurant without the ""We're too good to serve you"" attitude. Having been here three times, I would strongly recommend the Bananas Foster Crepe, it is heavenly. Being on a college student budget, I typically just order an appetizer, and dessert to share! It is plenty filling, and you won't break the bank. Their mussels, when in season, are incroyable!  Plus, the bread that they give you for free is fresh, anything free is great on my list. It's worth the drive to the strip if you're looking for a great, fresh, French meal!"
681,"The Hot on Yelp list has yet to steer me wrong. The buffet line at the Bellagio was too long, so we looked for the closest alternative without a long wait.Lunch was amazing starting with warm baked bread and butter, and awesome smoked salmon and brioche and capers. We had the steak frites, ordered medium rare, but it came out closer to medium well. The waiter gave us two sauces. The blue cheese sauce was nicely buttery, but be sure to break up large chunks of cheese for a more blended flavor. The second sauce were caramelized onions in a nice, but powerful red wine sauce. Tip: Pour blue cheese sauce over steak and fish out onions to top your cut gives you the flavor of the soaked in wine sauce, but it doesn't overpower the dish. The frites reminded me of chip like fries, thin and crunchy like chips, shaped like fries. The thyme seared salmon was beautifully cooked, moist and topped over a bed of orzo spinach and peas.The cocktails are delicious, yet strong. The Nutty Russian was my first drink of the day, but by the end of it, I was close to drunk. But then again at $12.95 for one, I better be drunk after.Overall, with a view of the Bellagio water works and plenty of people watching, it was a pleasant meal and I'm definitely coming back to try the mussels in herbs and white wine sauce. The table next to us inhaled it!"
682,"I decided to try Mon Ami Gabi after there was such high ratings from Yelp Reviewers. I can see why! First off I had their French Onion Soup, the cheese they use is absolutely fantastic. I don't know how to describe it, but the soup was delicious and the cheese just complemented it so well!It was the second best onion soup I've ever had. The first was a place in 4 star restaurant in Mexico. I then had the croque madame which was nicely priced compared to other places in Las Vegas. It can be a little oily for those that are a little more health conscious. The only beef I had was that their Frites were really oily. I could literally feel the oil gush out from them and so I didn't eat a lot of them. The service was friendly, people were attentive and ensure that the experience went pleasantly. If given the chance, I would go back and eat there again."
683,Came here for New Years Eve brunch.  So glad we made reservations because there was a two hour wait!  I ordered a mimosa and the onion soup and boy was that the richest most delicious onion soup I've ever had!  The boyfriend had sangria and lamb sandwich and it too did not fail.  The prices were great and the view was spectacular.  It was freezing in Vegas but they had many heat lamps on the patio so that you can enjoy your meal shiver free and have a great view of The Bellagio fountains.  Will definitely come back again!
684,"As a belated birthday present, I wanted to take my sister to a nice restaurant of her choice.  She read about Mon Ami Gabi and wanted to try their breakfast so we made our reservation via Open Table for December 27th at 10 AM.  When I made the reservation, there was a box I could write a note to the Maitra D'.  I wrote we're celebrating my sister's belated birthday and she wanted to have the breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi.  Hoping we could order a dessert and I could ask them for a candle or something for her but when we get there, we're never asked about it at all. We were there a few minutes early.  I don't know how long she's been working for that day but the hostess at the door wasn't very welcoming and didn't even crack a smile.  The popular patio was wide open and it was a very nice morning so we decided to have a table out there.  She took us to the very end of patio where nobody was around, even though only less than 20% of tables were occupied at the patio.  It was still chilly and the heating pole wasn't lit yet.  When we asked her about it, she said it should be turned on soon and she left.  I was worried if our first experience at Mon Ami Gabi would be like her, stuck up with a horrible attitude.  However our waitress came immediately after the hostess left and told us this spot would be too cold for us and the heating pole was not working so she moved us to the right in the center where we're surrounded by three working heating poles.  If I were a manager or the owner of the restaurant, I would hire someone at least smiles for the ""greeting"" hostess.  I say the first impression is very important.Unlike the unfriendly hostess at the door, our waitress was fantastic.  She was very friendly and attentive, she made the rest of our M.A.G. experience so much better.The coffee was pretty good, not too weak but not too strong or bitter.  Their fresh squeezed orange juice was also good.  I've ordered their crab eggs benedict with breakfast potatoes and my sister ordered chicken and cheese crape.  When I saw my eggs benedict's potion, I was not sure if it would fill my big tummy but it did.  I didn't see the big chunk of crab meat but it sure did taste like crab and the buttery home fries (breakfast potatoes) were tasty too.  My sister's crape had some brie cheese in it and had a very elegant taste.  We're too full to order any desserts but I still wished if they asked me if I wanted to do something for my sister. By the end of our breakfast, the patio tables were completely full.  It was too early for Bellagio's fountain show but still it was fun to watch people who past by.  At least we had three or four people who shouted ""Viva Las Vegas!"" or something like that during our 1.5 hrs or so dining time and I thought there were more variety of fun and wacky people out there than my hometown Los Angeles.     The food was good if not exceptionally great.  With the patio seating and the great service we've got from our waitress, we'll be back for breakfast or lunch."
685,"In Vegas again and had to go back to Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast.   Love the fresh apple juice!!   This time,   I had the croissant breakfast sandwich and my friend had the lemon pancakes.   The portions are huge and the food is always great.    If you are in Vegas, this is a must try!   You will not be disappointed."
686,"LOVE this place - get a seat outside for a view of the Bellagio fountains, but be prepared to wait as they don't take reservations for outdoor seating.  I enjoy brunch here the most, but dinner is great too.  Fabulous french onion soup!"
687,"I love this place!  C'est super delicieux!  Despite the recent openings of many great restaurants in Vegas, Mon Ami Gabi is still one of my favorite restaurants in Sin City.  The place is always packed so make sure you have reservations and definitely sit at the outdoor patio to enjoy a great view of the strip and Bellagio's water show.  Their moules frites and steak frites are delicious.  Their cocktails are awesome too but if you don't drink, fret not, you'll also walk out french fries wasted since almost every entree comes with fries lolz.  Definitely try this restaurant out if you haven't yet."
688,"Food, Service, Bloody Mary Bar, The view of the water show is also fun to watch....Sit outside and people watch it is fantastic.  My friend and I both got the Croque Madame...amazing and it was a good amount of food! I really enjoyed my lunch."
689,"I'm addicted to their brunch - especially their daily Eggs Benedict special.  A favorite was the lobster benedict.  I've always been waited on my a kind and courteous staff.  And when the hostess says ""inside or outside"" she really means ""outside"", not a fake vegas ""outside"" with clouds painted on the ceiling.  Outside is strip side view right across from the Belagio fountains."
690,"Yes, the location is great, and the outdoor patio very inviting, but our brunch at Gabi was very disappointing. It was a cool, rainy day, so we sat inside. First, we ordered some fresh-squeezed juice. He had orange, which he enjoyed. I had grapefruit, which tasted like it had just started to turn...bitter with almost a fizz to it.  Next, coffee. It was on the weak side, and since I sweeten my coffee with honey rather than sugar, I asked for some...twice...it never came.  I had seen the chocolate-bacon waffle with warm maple syrup advertised from the street, and had been fantasizing about it for days. I ordered that, while the bf ordered the corned beef hash and eggs.  Both entrees arrived barely room temperature, but it had taken so long already we decided against trying to flag the waitress down again. The corned beef had good flavor, but the meat was a little stringy. The waffle was decent, but the saddest part was the ""hot maple syrup."" Now I am a New-England girl, and picky about my maple syrup, but I think anyone paying $12 for a waffle should rightfully expect real maple syrup.  This was not. It was the typical maybe-maple-flavored corn syrup you'd find at any cheap diner. Yuck! Totally unacceptable. We finished quickly and left. In a way I regret not speaking up, but it wasn't the server's fault, and it was so busy... Maybe the location and views from the patio are enough for some, but if you're going for good food I'd go elsewhere."
691,"Got the special lunch plate of the day.  I wasn't a huge fan of it, and our waitress no questions asked, took it back, brought me out the chicken club and the french onion soup(really good also).  The location is great, I enjoy people watching and if you got a seat outside you can enjoy the nice weather(non-summer)."
692,I always come to Mon Ami Gabi for at least 1 dinner with a large group of at least 10 or more and we are all never disappointed!Always a good meal without the Vegas hype or sky high prices!!
693,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. It's in a gorgeous location - if you sit outside you have an amazing view of the Bellagio as your backdrop. My party of 6 came here for lunch on a Sunday, and we were seated immediately. I ordered French toast from the Brunch menu, ~$10. I don't even like French toast all that much - but it was perfection. The toast was soft and spongey, and it came with really good blueberry jam/sauce. The whip cream was also very light so I didn't feel bloated after. The $3 coffee was also really great. They give you free refills, which I failed to realize when I gave a waiter my cup. It's not too bitter, and tastes perfect with a bit of cream. Other notable/good dishes:+ Jumbo Lump Crab Salad Tartine+ Most of the salads After the meal I felt full in a very satisfying way - great place to sit and relax and enjoy your food and the view."
694,"Food was OK, but service was terrible.  Our server never came back to our table to check if we need another drink, water, bread, etc.  We had to get somebody else's attention for our need.  At the end, they included 18% tipping which is their policy for 5 or more people.  We just wanted to let them know she did not provide us service enough for 18% tipping.  When we called the manager, he was worse.  He said, ""did you get your food?  did you get your drink?  then what is your problem?  I am missing your point"".   Four of my friends came from Japan.  They totally ruined our time."
695,"Oh what a gorgeous lunch i had here. And i am referring to the food.I ordered an endive and pear salad as an appetizer with a glass of freshly squeezed OJ. I had a freshly ground Ahi Tuna burger with fries for my entree, and finally, the most beautiful apple tart for dessert. Honestly, everything tasted so good that i just wanted to sit there forever and savor every last bite.Everything is crafted very well, the service is great and the food is very fresh. And you really need to try that Ahu Tuna burger - it's very moist (contrary to the name) and very nicely flavored. The apple tart is unlike a typical fruit tart - the apple had been cramelized forever so it was very flavorful, the crust wasn't too thick so it didn't overshadow the apple. Go try it and enjoy the view:)"
696,"I've always wanted to enjoy brunch at a french bistro/cafe with my closest friends full of good food. Check! I found this place and my friend raved about the French onion soup. I shared a ham&cheese crepe and french onion soup and we couldn't finish it! The crepe was huge for about $10. The french onion soup was about $8 and topped with melted cheese on top (torched). Towards the end, the flavors became a little overwhelming with all the salty taste. Regardless, just don't overeat here and try to share dishes to get the most of what they offer!"
697,"They seated us in the indoor patio area (in view of the Bellagio fountain!), nice ambience and great service!! Their French onion soup was very good,  We also got their potatoes gaufrettes with side of blue cheese dipping sauce, the blue cheese dipping sauce tasted really fresh and surprisingly light.  Their side of frites (or fries) was interesting, they're cut into short slivers and fried, while crispy, it would have been nice to have the fries be a bit more substantial since they tasted like leftover frites at the bottom of the bag.The highlight for me was their crepe with chicken and apples (all sliced evenly and thinly for the perfectly distributed bite).  It was a generous portion, served with a creamy, white sauce to dip all the goodness into.  Their frisee salad with bacon and a soft-poached egg was delicious too!!!  The egg was perfectly poached!!"
698,"As good as it gets in Vegas for people watching paired with great food and excellent service.  The outdoor patio is the place to be anytime of year,  heaters when it's cool and misters in the heat let you enjoy the views of the Bellagio fountains as well as the variety of strip goers.  Can't miss with the French Onion soup."
699,"The food was pretty good, not the best, but still very good.If you come here, you have to sit at the patio.  The view is AMAZING!  The beautiful view of the Bellagio fountain and the good food and wine equals a very romantic date."
700,"This place has it all! Great ambiance, great food, and a friendly wait staff. When we first saw it, it seemed like it would be a long wait but they buzzed us about a minute later. I had the prime-rib special and it was delish!!!! My friends ordered steak from medium to well-done and each was said to be perfect! Aside from the food, the place has nice soft lighting, great for romantic dates or just out with friends. The wait staff was very attentive and often checked in with us... he also chatted a little with us so that was nice as well. Great place!"
701,"Mon Ami Gabi is a quaint French restaurant, located in Paris Resort and Casino. It was a bit far from the center of the strip ~10 minutes walking. The decorum of the restaurant was very cute and resembles a modern cafe in France. Casual and delicious! Service was OK in that there seemed to be no designated waiter per table so you had to flag one down to ask for the check. However, they did refill our glasses multiple times, so I can't complain. Bottled or sparkling water are complimentary. I recommend coming for brunch, which is only offered on weekends. Their lunch menu is very limiting but it is still possible to pick out some interesting and tasty dishes. If you have never had escargot, I would recommend trying it at Mon Ami Gabi because it is not as slimy (which may seem revolting).I came here on weekday afternoon. We started with the Escargots de Bourgogne which is oven roasted snails cooked in garlic herb butter. I believe this is true, butter makes EVERYTHING tastes good. ;) I like escargot and this dish made me like it more. If I had a larger group and a bigger appetite, I would have tried more dishes from their Hors D'Oeuvres because it truly gives you a taste of authentic french cuisine. I would recommend Country Style Pâté, Chicken Liver Mousse, Sea Scallops Gratinées  and Oysters Du Jour if you're feeling adventurous.For lunch, their offerings are predominantly, sandwiches, crepes, salads and steak frites (which is essentially steak with thinly cut fries).For brunch, I have heard good things about their french toast, pancakes, crepes and eggs benedicts. The two of us ordered the Croque Madame and Seafood Crepe for entrees. Croque Madame was fine but the seafood crepe was show-stopper. First of all, the crepe was buttery and thin, strewn over with a béchamel cream sauce. The shrimps and scallops were fresh, tender and sweet. And the combination of textures and flavors satiated my palate. Definitely recommended!Overall, I enjoyed Mon Ami Gabi and will come back next time for their brunch. Our check came out for ~$17 pp, which was reasonable compared to how much we ate. Also, they provide complimentary, fresh-baked french baguettes. Love!"
702,"Quality food, ambiance, moderate pricing . . . what more could you want?  The lemon-thyme salmon on orzo with peas and spinach was perfect, but the real find was the French onion soup with gruyere cheese.  OMG!  The portions are not skimpy either.  Didn't have room for desert (darn!), but I'll bet they're heavenly.  Oh, yes, it's across from Bellagio and you get to watch the water displays.  It was a wonderful date night!"
703,"If I could give it ZERO stars I would.I have dined here numerous times and clearly liked it to return each time.  However, the last time was just that, the LAST TIME.  The service was appalling.  My guest was not feeling well and upon telling two waitresses this, the bottle of water and bread arrived 15 minutes later...We were ready to order as we knew it would take quite a while given the restaurant was filling up...but our waitress was clearly more excited about having 5 men to serve because they were seated a good 10 minutes after us, however they had their wine order taken, wine poured and food orders taken while we were still waiting to be noticed!!  I asked one waitress for the check and told her I'd like to pay for my bottle of water and why I was leaving.  She told our waitress who clearly shooed her away and scoffed. I informed the manager who very obviously should NOT be holding the position he is as his response to me was ""Well, then leave!"" quite loudly....oh, but that was after he charged me the $7.50 for the bottle of water.  WOW - customer service 101.  Last time I checked...I'm one of the people PAYING TO EAT THERE and the STAFF are the folks BEING PAID TO WORK THERE...Good thing I have a choice where I can spend my $$.  Pathetic."
704,"With each annual trek to Vegas that my hubby and I make, we make sure to have dinner here.  Since we usually go to LV in June, we dine outside on the patio each time.  Waiters prompt and service excellent although we did get a laugh the last time because our waiter had this cheesy french accent and when we were leaving we heard him talking to other waiters and he had a total east coast accent!!   Never a bad meal, steaks are wonderful. Large wine selection although fewer lesser priced options then higher priced ones.  Banana's Foster for dessert is divine!  We will be back again and again I'm certain!"
705,"yumyumyum! My first French restaurant. It was really classy inside & a nice place to take a date, and I guess sitting outside is the business cause it was packed outside, but pretty empty inside. I had the Seafood Crepe for about $14, which was filled with peas & cream & topped with jumbo shrimp & giant delishhh scallops. I shared with a friend, and was satisfied. We originally planned to go to the Bellagio Buffet around 3, but stopped by here for a quick bite since we were starving...but were too full by the time we finished & had to postpone our buffet plans. Bon Appetit!"
706,Great service and mimosas!
707,This was my favorite meal last visit to Vegas. Had the flat iron steak with the bordelaise sauce and french onion soup. Will be back.
708,"Mon Ami Gabi is a cute French restaurant located in the Paris Resort and Casino. I came here with a group of my girlfriends for lunch. I was a little wary about the restaurant because whenever I hear ""French food"" I immediately think expensive. Thankfully, the prices at Mon Ami Gabi were very reasonable.I ordered the Seafood Crepe (~$14), and it is HEAVENLY. If you love seafood like me, it's an absolute must. The scallops were seared perfectly, the shrimp was perfect, the peas were a perfect addition to the plate -- the dish was perfectly perfect. My friend and I shared the crepe and got full off of that. We were originally going to go to the Bellagio Buffet a few hours after, but decided to save that for another day because Mon Ami Gabi got us stuffed!Service was very accommodating. We had two guests that came later than we did, and they had no problem with adding them to our table. Water glasses were always filled, bread was always served, and our entrees didn't take too long to wait for. I'd definitely come back again."
709,"Made reservations for dinner here on a weekday.  They had no problem seating us early and we were able to get a table outside.  Even when it's cold out, this is the best place to eat as you get a really great view of the Bellagio fountains during your meal.  The inside has a nice ambiance as well, but get a table outside if you can.  Our waiter was incredibly attentive throughout the meal, refilling water, asking if we wanted more bread (the bread was delicious, btw), etc.  She even anticipated that we wanted separate checks and was more than happy to arrange it, which sadly most restaurants get very bitchy about.We all got a steak entree with frites.  Don't order any side dishes - they give you a MOUNTAIN of frites!  I could barely finish half of them.  My steak was quite large as well.  I had the steak bordelaise, which had a yummy caramelized onion and wine sauce with it.  My friends had the filet mignon and the steak bearnaise, which were both very good.  Perhaps it wasn't the best steak I've ever had, but still excellent.  And with the addition of the ambiance and the service, I have to give this place 5 stars.To clarify, this is a $$ restaurant if you order a non-steak entree (they have burgers, sandwiches, chicken, fish etc.) or a steak frite entree (the thin cuts of steak) without drinks, appetizers or dessert.  If you order one of the more select steak cuts or start adding sides to your meal, this is more of a $$$ restaurant."
710,"I came here for brunch on a Saturday and had tea, croissants, and their eggs benedict. The eggs were delicious! They were made just right and served over a large slab of Canadian bacon and a large, perfectly toasted English muffin drizzled with Hollandaise sauce. There were two, and was accompanied by hash browns, which I loved. They were the perfect crisp and saltiness. I definitely want to go back and try their other menu items."
711,"Even on a cold winter morning, breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi was still a solid option! If you've read about my past experiences here, then you'll probably already know what to expect from this review.It was very chilly outside when I had breakfast here for my last meal in Vegas before flying home and it was also still early so the heat lamps out on the patio weren't fired up yet, so they had seated at a very cozy table by the window, which was still a great spot for some early morning people watching.Since I didn't want to take the risk in picking something new that could potentially result in a disappointing last meal in Vegas, I took the safe option and went with their Eggs Benedict (14.95) since I had their Crab Cake Eggs Benedict (15.95) last time and loved it.  And once again I had their fresh OJ and bottomless Coffee.  As expected, the Eggs Benedict was perfect (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw&select=JwV3dbADg-18GS6NESEBSQ).  Every bite was scrumptious!  And once again, the Hash Browns were packed with flavor with the caramelized onions inside.  Loved it!!And there isn't much more I can say about their morning service other than it was spot on like last time.  Though it was a little more busier, I didn't have 20 or so waiters refilling my half empty cup of coffee every 5 mins.  Oh well, can't complain too much about that since I still had a very good waitress.I'm really starting to enjoy Mon Ami Gabi a lot more as a breakfast option as the place is more mellow and very relaxing compared to the more active atmosphere for lunch and dinner, but you do miss out on the Fountains of Bellagio as they start up later in the day.  If you haven't stopped by here yet for a bite, give it a try and dine out on the patio when the weather is nice.  It definitely makes for a great first or last meal in Vegas."
712,"We were there for new year's eve dinner. Outdoor seating for 15 people, they were really nice to take our reservation the morning of. It's a $110/ person set menu not including drinks. Yea...a little on the pricey side, but the location and view is great! The food is not bad either, the waitress was awesome! She made our night!!!! Would def. go back again anytime!"
713,"Very nice location and ambiance on the patio.  Even though it was cold, the heaters keep you toasty warm!  Great views of Bellagio Fountains in the evening and good people watching!  Food was very good, not the best but certainly good.  Two entrees and 2 glasses of bubbly and our bill was only $70.  Good, attentive service and food recommendations.  Can't beat the value!!"
714,"Mussels - Were good. More on the expensive side though. The wine sauce was tasty as well. Fries were small and crispy. Maybe too small for me though. Duck confit - Tasty, especially the skin. Would order again. The lentils under the duck were also tasty. Cod special - The fish itself was good but the dish as a whole was bland. Scallops- Were really good. Nice texture and flavor. I usually don't like scallops."
715,"It was late and the husband and I hadn't eaten dinner yet.  I was fearful that we wouldn't find a thing considering it was prime time dinner time in Vegas on one of the busiest (for weddings) weekends of the year (10/10/10).Mon Ami Gabi, is not only fun to say, but is a casual french-style dining experience.  The menu had all sorts of good red meat choices: steaks and whatnot; and some onion soup, etc.  But the pricing seemed ... eh ... a little high.  But whatever, we managed to get a seat at the teeny bar (seats 6-8) and talked it up with the bar guy, really cool dude.This is going to sound boring, but Dave and I ordered the onion soup and shared a burger (we did not intend to go all out this night), which was the perfect choice for the bar seating, right?  Heck yes. The burger was simple in its presentation, nothing out of the ordinary, but the cooking temp and size and vehicle were stupendous and delicious!  So juicy and came with some great skinny frites (those French!!)."
716,"What a people watching place to eat in Vegas!  Sit outside and watch the march of tourists, Elvis impersonators, Jack Sparrow with parrot, drunken locals, and more. The Bellagio water show is directly across the street  and this is a  spectacular vantage point to watch the show from.I enjoyed a delicious glass of Sauvignon Blanc from their very large wine list along with a delicious Steak Classic with Frites.  All done perfect!As I am writing this, the water cannons are blowing once again from the Bellagio fountains!  One of the best in Vegas!"
717,"I'm going to keep this short and sweet:  I feel like I always want to eat here every time I'm in Vegas!!!  What I love about this place:- French onion soup is delicious! - Outdoor seating offers a perfect view of the Strip and the Bellagio Fountain show- Service was attentive and promptThere's always a ton of people here, so make sure you make reservations - if not, expect to wait about 45 min - 1 hour."
718,"The best part of this restaurant is that most seatings will pit you right in front of the Bellagio water show. Romantic, but without suffering from the pish and posh you get from a snooty upscale restaurant. Bread as an appetizer, and both my hot girlfriend and I both had meat from their steak frites section. While I can't say it was a life changing experience, it was definitely above par. I don't believe this is a steak centered establishment, since the palm frites was clearly a show stealer. An absolutely perfect addition to the food, and a definite winner.Romantic, not terribly expensive, and the staff were accommodating even when we were late."
719,I had my bday brunch here.  The decor was a classic/ trendy tavern.  Everyone's dish was impressively presented.  I ordered the Lump Crab salad sandwich which was so good!! But the mussels are highly recommended.I'll come back again!!!
720,"4.2 stars.If you're going to come here, be sure to get a seat outside (if it's nice outside) or a seat by the window. You'll have a good view of the Bellagio fountain. Also, if you're at a good table, you'll have a good place to people-watch because the restaurant itself is on a prime location on the Vegas strip. If this place is expensive to you, then it's probably because of the location of the restaurant.As far as food, all I got was the Onion Soup and the Escargot. The Onion Soup was good but I've had better Escargot. The free bread they provide was also pretty tasty.Overall, my experience here was good and I'd come back, especially since it's a central location on a strip and the food is good.Lastly, our server was kind of creepy."
721,"I was in Las Vegas for a convention and staying at the Aria. After days of hotel food compliments of our hosts, I was really craving something spectacular. The reviews sounded promising, so we decided to give it a try. The ambiance and view were great - right across from the Bellagio fountains. We got to see the water show every 15 minutes which was fun. It was freezing out but the heat lamps kept us warm enough. Service there is top notch and we loved our waiter.As for food, we ordered two bowls of the french onion soup. I thought it was okay but I've had better. I liked that they used gruyere cheese but I thought that there was just way too much cheese and that the soup was a bit salty for my taste. As an appetizer we ordered the Chicken Pate. This by far was my favorite for the night. The little pickles and bread they served with the Pate complimented it just perfectly. For the entree, I had the filet mignon which was tender and flavorful but not the best filet I've had. The sauce was pretty good and I enjoyed myself. Top this off with a glass of Merlot and good company - recipe for a wonderful evening. I would definitely bring some friends back here for dinner again. I'll have to try other items on their menu but I'm definitely ordering the Pate again!"
722,"One of the best places to eat in Las Vegas, Mon Ami Gabi is the perfect restaurant whether its only you and your significant other, or a group of 8! I came here with a group of friends for my boyfriend's 30th birthday. We had made reservations ahead of time through their website and noted that we were celebrating his birthday and requested a table near the windows so that we would have a view of the Bellagio fountains.When we got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately and got a wonderful table inside by the window and the view was amazing! On a side note, if the weather permits it, it is definitely worth it to wait for a table on the outside patio. The restaurant does NOT reserve these outdoor tables, so it is on a first-come-first-serve basis. But you can still request a table inside with a view.Fresh french bread was brought with some creamed butter and a little bit of something that resembled a reddish pink coleslaw, but it was so tasty with the bread! I ordered a caraffe of the Frangria (so delicious) and a bottle of Perrier water for the table, and my boyfriend ordered a separate glass of wine. For appetizers, my boyfriend and I shared a shrimp cocktail. Our friends ordered a Caesar salad and a French onion soup that had the cheesiest layer of cheese baked right on top!I ordered the steak classique rare. My boyfriend ordered the sea scallops, and our other friend ordered the beef bourguignon. One thing I noticed when they served the beef bourguignon was that the server kept the noodles and beef stew separate and spooned the stew on top of the noodles at our table. It looked and tasted so rich and beefy and stewy! Everything looked fantastic! I have to admit that my steak was a little hard to cut and was chewy, but it was because I had ordered it rarer than usual. The finely cut pommes frites were also a perfect addition to my steak. At the end of it all, we decided to get dessert at another place just to explore more sweet options, but the waitress brought us a complimentary profiterole, a pastry that was filled with ice cream  and topped with a candle for my boyfriend! Next time I am definitely staying after dinner for an artisan cheese platter or a crème brûléeMon Ami Gabi's prices were another big reason I chose to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday there. The prices are very fair for the quality of food, service, and experience you get and also low enough to not break the bank or feel guilty that one of your friends could only afford a glass of water. I will definitely be returning to Mon Ami Gabi to celebrate my birthday!Although the service was awesome, the view was phenomenal, and the food tasted great, we still had one gripe: being a very classic French bistro, there simply was not enough food on the plates for both my very American boyfriend and his friend. They ended up leaving and buying a hamburger right after dinner haha! So I recommend Mon Ami Gabi if you and your date aren't too hungry, or with a group of girls. But if you're not into French restaurants with relatively smaller portions, head for the Bellagio Buffet across the street. : )"
723,"Great location, classic decor, fair prices and large portions! Had the strawberry skinny pancake aka French crepe and it was delicious and very filling. With unlimited coffee, a glass of milk, tip & tax the total came out to $20 not bad at all! Service was great & waiter even took back a crepe my friend ordered after it had arrived & he noticed it was too much food to go along with his egg combo."
724,"This restaurant is wonderful!  I had the Lemon Chicken Paillard and it was delicious.  The atmosphere was romantic, the staff was friendly and attentive.  Everything was superb."
725,"Holy Chicken liver MOUSSE!If you like liver, try it! order order order! It was mild, buttery and if you are anemic like me, this is the dish that will get your iron going! IT WAS SOOO GOOD! It was served with buttery toasts, mini pickles and cocktail onions with a touch of liver horseradish type of sauce. It was so perfect! I asked for some more toasts later on and packed it up to-go, which i later enjoyed eating on the way back home to the OC ^_^I had a seafood crepe and wow! the scallops couldn't be bigger or tastier. Jumbo shrimp!My bf had the jumbo crab cake and damn was it JUMBO! it was filled with crab.J'adore 'Mon Ami Gabi'!"
726,"Breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi. The food here is reasonably priced which was a nice surprise. Skinny Pancake - Lemon: I was pleasantly surprised by this dish. The French don't make pancakes. They make crepes! The ""pancake"" is a few layers of crepe with caramelized lemon sugar, powdered sugar and fresh strawberries on top. It also comes with whipped cream and strawberry sauce.I was not overwhelmed with my meal but it's a lovely breakfast place with a nice view of the strip. I'd come back for another brunch."
727,"Brunch here is pretty good.  The weather was gorgeous and we got seated in the ""indoor patio"" area, where we're indoors but have wonderful views of the strip and the Bellagio watershow (my favorite!).  Yayyyyy!  I wanted to be healthy and recover from the night before so I went for the Butter Lettuce and Honey Crisp Apple Salad.  I saw people from two other tables order it around us and figured it would be good.  It was actually pretty good.  The aged goat cheese was the perfect compliment to the beets and light dressing on the lettuce.  Although the serving was on the smaller side, I was still full with that and the bread.  We shared pitchers of the sangria, which was pretty stiff, but had a lot of good fruity flavors.  The server was interesting (he pretty much shared his whole life story to us in 3 minutes), but it definitely didn't bother us."
728,"Great Service, food and view. We loved it fro breakfast!"
729,"The greatest thing that this restaurant offers is an outdoor patio directly across from the fountains of Belaggio. That is it. The service was poor, aka, non existent. I ordered a Tom Collins to drink, and it was garnished with a cherry, slice of lime, and piece of hair. Lovely. Then came my chicken club. I had asked my server what the sandwich consisted of, and he was not too sure what came on it. Sadly, not much. Toasted bread, as little chicken as possible, and a couple pieces of bacon and a leaf or two of lettuce. Oh, and no mayonnaise on it. This thing was dry as the desert itself. And the 'pom frites' may as well be called potato chip crumbs. Yuck. I usually like to gives a restaurant I didn't enjoy another chance to redeem itself, but I will not be doing that with this place. Eat at Earl of Sandwich instead."
730,"The $$ (it's $$$) is completely inaccurate and whoever voted for that was either ordering a sandwich and/or too wasted to realize what they were paying.That being said, I did enjoy my visit here, although not what I expected, price aside. The place was dimly lit, nice on a date, not so nice if you'd like to do some work or read (I read the reviews saying casual). I started with a mixed green salad which came with a nice light vinaigrette but the greens could have been cut down to a bite size so I didn't have to feel like a rabbit. For my entree, I had the special for the night which was a half roast duck in sweet sauce.  The hint of licorice was a nice touch and added some kick to an otherwise standard dish. However, the half duck was just that, and you will need experience as a butcher to cut through it in a non-insane way.The server was polite despite my odd appearance, trying to catch up on some reading in a dimly lit restaurant. There was the added bonus of having a magical experience with the Bellagio water show out the window. I can recall a local telling me, ""yeah, we got culture, the Bellagio water show"" - ehhh, maybe not so much...but cute anyhow."
731,"This is a must visit for my friends & family every time we're in Vegas.  We absolutely adore this place!!!!  Such great price for the quality of food and it's consistently phenomenal.First of all, let me start by saying the bread is to DIE FOR!!!!  We go through at least 4 rolls.  Order the chicken liver mousse and eat it w/ the bread, I promise you won't regret it!  The quiche is the go-to fave for me.  Frangria's worth trying especially if you're doing an early brunch.  Chicken broccoli crepe is good also.  The tuna special open face sandwich was delish as well.  Service is always pleasant and food always comes out quickly.  Again the bread is key!If you're looking for somewhere to eat on the strip, don't hesitate and come to Mon Ami Gabi, it's totally worth it!!!!"
732,"Great restaurant!  Given the outdoor seating with a view of the Bellagio fountains and the Eiffel Tower, this place is a great after dark spot to hit during the summer.  I've had several entrees and desserts on the menu, and each item was amazing.  It's a little spendy, which is to be expected for any restaurant on the strip, but if you can manage to get an outdoor seat it's well worth it.  The seating is elevated from the strip, so it isn't like you have people walking by and sticking their heads in to have a look at your meal.  I would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a nice and memorable meal on the Strip."
733,"I have been wanting to eat at MAG rest ever since I drove by it back in the days, finally we decide to eat here for Valentine's weekend since we were in town. We are seated in the Pavilion which was really nice and fun (very romantic too), reminds me of Dubai restaurants. I ordered the french onion soup which I am dying to try; it was very good, but I honestly don't think it was the best I have had, maybe it was my cup, but there was really a lot of cheese, I mean do not get me wrong, I LOVE CHEESE, but there was almost more cheese than onion broth!!!! I swear I could feel my thighs expand with each spoon of cheesy soup!!! For lunch entree I had the Warm chicken & Bree sandwich which was OK!! nothing out of the ordinary. My husband ordered the cream of mushroom (i think thats the name) which was delicious. And for lunch he had the Quiche Lorraine which was really really really buttery. My husband is not a difficult man to please when it comes to food. He never leaves a plate with food on it.  Today was the first time seeing him barely touch his plate! I am not sure if it was the eggs or the butter or the crust being even triple buttered as well, it just was not good! You can say that I am a harsh critic, but my God my husband didn't finish it!!! I could not even swallow the bite I tried!!!! I had high hopes after reading all the yelp reviews! I wish it was better, maybe the steak would have been a safer order which was his original thought but poor thing he figured he would try something different!!! LOVE THE BREAD STICK though and the atmosphere."
734,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  Their steak classique and frites are so tasty.  Still, my personal favorite is their creme brulee.  It never disappoints.  It's great that you can sit outside because you get a nice view of the strip, but they need to expand it.  Every time I go there, there is a really long wait to eat outside, but the interior decor is very classy and the servers are pleasant, so try it!"
735,"This had to be one of the highlights of our trip. We decided to spend our first morning in Vegas enjoying an amazing breakfast, and we found it. My girlfriend ordered 3 sunnyside eggs and bacon and a fruit salad, I ordered the Eggs Benedict special. It was so good it was actually ridiculous. They had it for us in just minutes and only $10 a plate! The best part was sitting out on the patio infront of the Eiffel tower on a nice sunny morning. If you're going to Vegas, come here for breakfast! Just do it!"
736,"My Friend Gabi certainly doesn't NEED another 5 star review, but she's gonna get one... NOW!We ate here twice during our stay at the Paris and both times were fantastic! Once for dinner and once for brunch.The roquefort steak and frites were amazing! The steak wasn't what I expected. It was really flat and about a foot long and 8 inches wide! But It was cooked and seasoned to perfection and I ate every last bite. I even ate every single meat-juice-soaked frite! Yah, I was stuffed to the point of being sick, but I ran 4 miles earlier in the day, so get off my case about it!!The eggs benedict dish was out of this world. Super rich and creamy, with the perfect amount of tang. I poured the entirety of one of those little tiny Tabasco bottles over the meal and it became the world's perfect hangover cure!The service was slow at times, but not enough to diminish our experience by even a half-star. Merci Beaucoups Gabi!!"
737,"This is one of my favorite breakfast spots in Vegas. Everything is good, but I especially love the French onion soup, mushroom and Brie omelette, and the bacon and chocolate waffles. The service is wonderful and the price is decent. Mon Ami Gabi, Je t'aime *muah muah*"
738,"Nice to eat out in the warm weather. Been to Vegas many many times and I've never stopped here but its always crowded. One of our friends ate here on their recent trips and said they enjoyed it a lot. Glad I came here on a recent trip I took! The wait was not long at all, they said 15-20 min est, but it was more like 10min and that went the same for the people ahead of us. The service was awesome, or server was a guy and he offered us clubbing info too, who to talk to if we needed a hook to get in the clubs etc. AWESOME!! We ordered the scallop appetizer, steak fritte, and bake cheese. Scallop appetizer come in quantity of three, and is covered with cheese and grilled onion. This dish was good, but i was just sick of cheese and grilled onion by the time I got to it. I was expecting more scallops but its ok, it's Vegas, you get what you paid for. The bake cheese was extremely to die for. It was covered in this red tomato soup sauce. I would just come back for this dish alone. Steak Fritte. Steak was extremely tender and yummy! It also comes with a generous size portion of grilled onions. Will come back again the next time I'm in vegas!"
739,"Cute little French Bistro! It's the perfect place to sit outside in warm weather as well.It was pretty busy when I went, so I'm not sure if that kind of attributed to the less than impeccable service (Hey, i get it. People get tired and overwhelmed so they only lost one star for this.) The other star is for the location. It's conveniently located on the strip and right across from the Bellagio and the water fountain, but at the time there was construction going on and the people that were walking by were the obnoxious drunks/people recovering from the night before.But we didn't let that ruin our lunch, we took in the Bellagio Fountain shows that would come on ever 15-30 minutes and ate our Grilled Salmon and Spinach Salad, and Mon Ami Caesar Salads and basked in the warm Las Vegas weather.Ultimately, it was pretty good.Seeing as how we only ordered salads, I can't exactly give them major kudos on their food but the combination of ingredients in the salad were pretty good, and the spinach/lettuce leaves were very fresh."
740,"So it was my birthday...........We were seated outside the weather was so comfortable. I had filet with merlot sauce, crusty bread, red wine....... AMAZING!!!! (everyone had something different, All delicious)Then,  the water show from the beligio came on..................the sound of ""Frank"" singing to me.What an amazing surprise.  It was a dining experience I will never forget."
741,"We visited Mon Ami Gabi on a weeknight after making reservations online. We were sat right away. After our server introduced himself we ordered wine...or tried to. My wife wanted a sauvengion blanc, but he said they were out for the evening. She asked what relatively sweet wine they had and he said ""none"" and then brought her a sample of Riesling, which was described on the wine list as ""very dry."" Don't get me wrong, the service wasn't bad, he just seemed to have a bit of French ""snottiness"" to him, which made the experience a little awkward.He recommended the specials of the evening, one of which was a bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin with potatoes. I took his suggestion and my wife ordered the salmon. Both were very good and we had a wonderful meal overall and would go back if/when we return to Vegas. With wine, entrees, tax and tip the meal came to about $80"
742,Great breakfast menu and view of the strip.  We did not get to sit outside but close enough.  I wasn't feeling well so I only ordered coffee and the crossiant sandwich.  The coffee was not very good considering it was French.  Very watered down.
743,Our party of 4 enjoyed a very nice table with Sean as our waiter. The warm olives and potato chips were excellent appetizers. I enjoyed my recommended filet mignon au poivre. Two others enjoyed the bolognaise. Overall a good choice for dinner.
744,"The food is solid french bistro faire, but the view of the Bellagio fountains, the restaurant decor, exceptional service, and decent prices are what really make this place.  Loved the baked cheese app, the bread pudding dessert and our attentive and friendly server."
745,"Very chic. Although, the menu items doesnt SCREAM French cuisine. Most foods looks like you can get at any American place.The food is awesome though. One of the few places I actually come out satisfied. I ordered the Smoked salmon platter. I enjoyed it. I enjoy simple foods. My plate had shreds of salmon, a pile of capers (I LOVE CAPERS) and a gallop of cream cheese. You also had a choice of an everything or plain bagel. I put everything together and it was simply delish.Service is super proper, like they were brainwashed. Not at all casual. Not that it hurts the business but it looks like they need to relax. Pricing is alright. My uncle and I sat outside during high noon and the sun was just right on top of us. I didnt mind, I had sunglasses but I DO absolutely love the view of the Bellagio and caught one of their water fountain shows."
746,Yum! I went for brunch and had the butternut squash and leek quiche and shared a fruit platter with my friends. Both were awesome!
747,"I hate writing reviews about Strip restaurants because I'm just 1 out of a 1000 reviews. But I felt strongly enough about my last visit to waste some time venting here. 7:30am on a brisk Saturday morning, I found myself crossing town on the way home from a night of a carousing. As I've been known to do on such nights, I decided it would be a fine time to indulge in a nice breakfast. Being that the weather was particularly tolerable for February, I decided to bask in it & dine on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi. I've enjoyed my similar visits in the past. Sure, the food isn't as good as Bouchon, but while it's not cheap, it's not quite as expensive, and the smoking-friendly patio has been enough to make up for any culinary shortcomings. So what happens when you disturb that equation? As it turns out, those pluses aren't strong enough to carry the place.There were two things in particular that chapped my ass. Firstly, there was the construction team out working or surveying or whatever on the patio. I got there pretty close to opening, and hey, the works gotta get done sometime. But the incessant pacing back & forth, discussion, and ladder-arranging turned out to be disturbing enough to aggravate my otherwise saintly patience. Being that I'm such a nice guy, by the time I'd had enough the place started filling up, so the construction team was forced out by necessity, so I never had to speak up. I was distracted enough by everything that I didn't notice how filthy my water glass was. I'm not the kind of guy to bitch about things like that, but it was bad enough that I didn't feel out of place for asking for another glass. I explained what happened to the waiter, and he quickly replaced my glass. I continued on with my meal, and as I was done I picked up my water to find that the new one was just as bad as the first. Now, you would think that when someone - right or wrong - brings up a complaint like that the staff would spend the extra 30 seconds it would take to find the shiniest glass in the rack. Not at Mon Ami Gabi! By this point I was done eating, so I decided to just mention it to the waitress when she asked how everything was. Well, that opportunity never presented itself (which is a problem unto itself in my opinion). Am I nitpicking? Maybe. But Mon Ami Gabi is by no means cheap, and their food is not so spectacular that it makes up for everything else. And sure, breakfast is considered a ""lesser"" meal at places like this, but that doesn't mean they get a pass on anything that happens before noon. A year ago this would've given them a 4 star review. Maybe I'll try again and see if I caught them on an off day."
748,"We were in Vegas this past Presidents Day weekend and ate here for breakfast.  It was good, not great.  Our chocolate croissant tasted like it was been reheated from a very average bakery, there was nothing flaky or buttery about it like a delicious French pastry should be.  My husband had the crouque madame which was really good and I had the lemon skinny pancake.  At first it was good, but then started to become a little dense and doughy.  Also, the service was just ok.  I told my server I did not want the whip cream with my pancake, not b/c of calories, just because I don't like whip cream that much, fresh or otherwise.  He insisted that I have it because I ""haven't tried theirs"".  Um, ok I have eaten at some of the best restaurants in the country and I'm pretty sure I have tasted great whip cream.  It came, I tasted some with my fork (average) and then when he came by at the end of our meal, he insisted that I I had not tasted any and preceded to inspect my cream!  It was just really annoying.  Anyway, breakfast here is pretty good, but not going out of your way for."
749,"I have come to the conclusion that not one single restaurant in Paris Hotel Casino Resort is edible.  Not the cafe(s), nor the buffet, and now add Mon Ami Gabi to the list.  I've been staying at this hotel/casino for 5 days (Thanks for the Comp Red Room, Paris!).  Our last night here so I thought I'd give this place a try.  I was hugely disappointed at my meal.  We were seated in the 'Atrium Room' with direct view of Bellagio Fountain.  Yes, it was nice but I came here for the food.  There is a door opened out to the outdoor seating area and the constant chill wind which cools the food very fast was not 'cool'.  The Jumbo Lump Crab Cake (celery root remoulade, gribiche sauce) was really average.  I'm glad it was grilled and not deep fried. The Butter Lettuce & Honey Apple Crisp Salad (roasted beets, aged goat cheese, apple cider vinaigrette)  was also forgettable.  I could barely taste the dressing.  The Roast Chicken & Frites ( all-natural roasted half chicken, mushrooms, bacon, pearl onions) - oh pleeeaaasssee!  Costco's Rotisserie chicken had more flavor than this.  It was dry and tasteless!The Filet Mignon (merlot butter, red wine reduction) which is their signature dish and you would think it should stand out!  First of all, I ordered it medium and it came as medium rare.  The sauce was supposed to be merlot butter but it was so bland that I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper to flavor it.  But after about 3 bites, I had to trade it with my fiance for his Roast Chicken which was even worse!  And those FRITES, what the hell were those?  String potato chips?  You could have served it with FRENCH fries and that would have been better.  Service was friendly but I wouldn't say it was attentive.  The waiter was more interested in talking to his fellow servers than to his guests.  It's food like this that reminds me of why I don't care for French restaurants!"
750,"What I Ordered: It was lunch, but I was feeling like eating brunch food so I ordered the Seafood Crepes. It consisted of a crepe with large, grilled shrimp and scallops with a cream sauce. The crepe contained peas and a cream filling. The dish was topped off with fresh raw spinach. What I Thought: The crepe was light and tasted great with the peas and cream sauce. The shrimp was seasoned well and tasted good, but a little overcooked. The scallops were my favorite part. It was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and had a nice crust on it. Overall: I thought the dish was good, but seemed to lack that oomph. Really this dish should be 3.5 stars if Yelp would let me. The restaurant itself is situated in a cool spot overlooking the strip across from the Bellagio Fountains."
751,"Note: Get a Mojito Maison that will butter you up in true French fashion with St. Germain, 10 Cane rum, and champagne because......it's either a hit or miss here.  I've been to Mon Ami a few times, and have had a range of experiences, anything ranging from 1 star to 5 stars, it's probably an average of 3.5 stars.Pros: rich duck liver moose, flavorful apple tart tatin, crispy hand-cut frites, terrace strip-view dining in the spring time facing the Bellagio fountains, pavilion seating facing the Bellagio fountains, potential attentive waiter, potential sweet hostess.Cons: mediocre steak au poivre, tourist crowds, pesky pagers, small bar with none-existent standing room, poor wine choices, potential rude hostess."
752,I don't know what the appeal of this place is..it has almost 900 reviews    ( at the time of me writing this review)...and a four star rating...and it was such a disappointment. I think people that eat here mainly go to eat out on the terrace and people-watch. Sole redeeming factor- great fries.
753,"Love, love, love Mon Ami Gabi. Killer style and decor, excellent location and views. And most of all, the food. Always very good and never fails to surprise in a good way. This time we had the fish of the day, Atlantic char. Light, flavorful, balanced nicely with spinach and potatoes.  Scallop appetizer was delicious, could have had more scallops. Steak bordelaise got rave reviews. A little too much salt on the chicken paillard.  Washed it down with champagne chilled exactly right. Gabi just puts me and friends in a happy, contented state for hours. What more can you ask?"
754,"Every time I'm in Vegas I end up spending the afternoon on the patio here resolving my hangover... You can't beat the view - the Bellagio fountains are immediately across the street.   Everything I've ever eaten here has been fabulous, from the atypical fish and chips to the mussels to the croque monsieur to the french onion soup. Full bar, wine, beer, etc. Great Frangria (their version of Sangria) - buy a carafe to get a better deal... Excellent people watching on the strip. The Atrium room is also a very nice place to sit, but I'd avoid the rest of the place as it is very dark. They've just added a bunch of gas heaters on the patio, so there are no excuses not to enjoy the patio, even on the cooler nights."
755,"I forgot about this pathetic place. Maybe it's just me, maybe it was just a bad Friday night...maybe it was just a terrible suggestion. but in the end, the lesson to be learned is that no one can upsell a cheapa$$ cut of cow (ie skirt steak) to a carnivore and throw in potato leftovers ( I mean LOUSY french fries)  on the dish to make it appealing. This establishment is why I hate trying new places out.. all the hype.. ohh the food is good, it rocks, we should try it.. yah yay yah.mmbop .. whatevers! NO, don't get the SKIRT STEAK, no matter WTF they called it, it's friggin carne asada! but REAL carne asada TASTES good! / end PSA. That is all...next time it's Del Friscos d-bags... no and's if's or but's!"
756,"Beverage - cappuccino - excellentFood - quiche and ham & cheese crepe - excellent Service - okAmbiance - great inside and out. Not particularly romantic for brunch, but very French feeling. They have a bloody Mary bar where you can pick your own condiments, which is pretty unique."
757,"Went out to dinner last night around 7 pm and it was a bit crowded but they had room for 2. Bigger parties, make a reservation  or wait 45 minutes. I had the Steak Frites Classique and the meat was really good. The ""frites"" which in French means fries were actually more like fries/chips...I was looking forward to the fries I grew up eating in France (they do taste differently than McDonald's!) unfortunately they have their special fries I guess. They were good but I was expecting something else.My friend had the chicken and fries, and the chicken was good but not exceptional. I would definitely recommend getting the steak, it's their specialty I think. A bit on the pricey side, with 3 small cheeses on a plate for $15.00! And the cocktail/ drink are on average $15.00 too so if you can wait..dine here but drink somewhere else. Service was great, they check on you but not too much that you want to tell your waiter ' here's $5.00 if you leave me alone for the rest of my dinner!'. But overall despite the prices the food overall was definitely a 4, the service was a 5 and the atmosphere was also a 5. No music too loud etc..good setting and if you eat on the terrace you have a view on the Bellagio Fountain."
758,"The food was delicious, prepared to perfection.  But the service, there were stretches of time when I was quite certain that our waiter had completely forgotten about us. The couple seated next to us came in well after us, but they were served their entre' before we even received our appetizers.  Kudos to the chefs but management either needs to hire more wait staff or cut back on the seating."
759,I reserved a long time in advance for a friend's birthday.  We requested a table in a quiet section and this wish was granted.  The service was ok.  The decor is nice.  It is a bit loud and crowded.  The food was ordinary.  I was expecting better.
760,"This restaurant is, THE PLACE, to bring people if your in need of a great strip restaurant with a view!  Perfect to take friends or family when they come to visit you in Vegas.The food is great & the atmosphere is incredible...  The prices are extremely  moderate for the value & all of the food is very well prepared, escargot were delicious as was my favorite steak & fries with blue cheese sauce, fantastic!  I recently took family from Maryland there for lunch & was extremely well taken care of by the staff & especially the manager Ryan. He gave us premier seating on the patio area outside & the view of the fountains across the street was perfect. Thanks Ryan!!!My family is still talking about how good the food was & such a great time they had... Kudos to the Mgmt & The Staff!Will be sure to visit again very soon..."
761,"I wish I could give it more stars! This is easily my most favorite restaurant in the world. I go to Las Vegas at least once a year and have eaten at Mon Ami Gabi many times for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have always, always, always had superior food. If possible, I like to sit outside, where the Bellagio fountains and the people watching put on a show that's tough to beat. Nevertheless, it's the food that keeps me coming back. Makes me want to hop on a plane right now!!"
762,"Great Sunday morning breakfast. We normally like going to the Paris buffet but with the cost for sunday brunch around $30 now we thought our money was better spent on smaller cheaper dishes. We got there around 9:30ish and got seated outside right away. Not 10 minutes later there was a line waiting for tables outside.We shared the cornbeef hash with poached eggs, which was very good, but having it served in a bowl-ish pooled up the oil in the dish. The wife got the bacon/chocolate waffles which is by far more tasty than a crepe. Served with syrup, fresh whip cream, and chocolate sauce.All very tasty and all for around 1 entrance into the buffet."
763,"Came here on a weekday night for dinner and it wasn't busy at all. It was pretty chilly so we chose to sit inside, window-side so we could still get a good view of the Bellagio fountain. Sadly the only view we had was of the street performer outside. You know, those creepy statue men that come to life??All the candles around the restaurant gives it a very romantic vibe. I felt out of place because everyone around us were, well, senior citizen status hahaha. We ordered soups to start. I got the ONION SOUP, which is like WOW MORE PLEASE!! Best french onion soup I've ever had in my life!! The portion was pretty generous, and it was half cheese (YAY CHEESE! =] ). Perfect flavor, perfect proportions of broth, onion, bread, and cheese. I could've had 10 of these! Bf ordered the SOUP DU JOUR, which was some sort of creamy bisque type thing, maybe potato? His soup was good too, and he actually liked it more than mine. If this was a soup review, I'd give it 5 stars hands down!!For entrees, we both got steak-frites. They were not satisfying at all. The steak was very thin and flat; we're not really fans of flat iron steaks. And they were cooked a little more than the medium-rare we ordered. I got the STEAK ROQUEFORT, which comes with a blue cheese sauce and fries. He got the STEAK BORDELAISE with its carmelized onions and red wine sauce. I preferred the onions and his sauce more than the blue cheese. The frites super thin, like onion straws. There was no potato substance at all, it tasted like pieces of fried..nothing? Sad.Later that night, we had a 5 dollar steak which we enjoyed more than the 25 dollar steaks at Mon Ami Gabi."
764,"I made reservations here and we were seated immediately upon arrival. They greeted us and sat us on the outdoor seating where you can see the Bellagio's fountain water show.The service was excellent and the server knew his menu very well, including the specials. I ordered the sweet potato soup and the croquet madam. French food, and the aura, very french! haha.Nonetheless, I recommend everyone coming here for Brunch. Their salads too, are to die for!!"
765,"After checking in at Paris we wandered down to Mon Ami Gabi which came recommended by a co-worker. It was only in the 40s so we wisely chose inside seating with a view of the Bellagio fountains. After looking at the first wine list that I'd seen with Cali Wines more expensive than French ones, we settled in with a nice red Bordeaux.Our appetizers included escargot which was a bit heavy on the parsley and WA State Oysters which had a much different, not bad, flavor profile then the Atlantic oysters I enjoy back home. Our steaks were very tender and cooked perfectly medium rare. We were running late for a show so our server offered coffee in a to go cup.The service was attentive, but not overbearing, the food good and the prices not bad for an on-strip restaurant."
766,"My wife wanted Paris, I wanted brunch, so we settled for Mon Ami Gabi, in the Paris Hotel in Las Vegas.  With a little bit of patients (about 20 minutes for a patio table), we where able to have a lovely brunch overlooking the fountain show at the Bellagio.  I truly feel that the setting made the food a bit better then it really was. it is more like a 3.5 star review but WTF"
767,"Not too pricey (for vegas) and great food. Very touristy, but hey what places aren't in Vegas? I had the delicious trout and caesar salad. good wine selection too."
768,"I ate the quiche, potato soup, steak, and burger, and their famous frittes however you spell it.  Everything was alright.  The frittes fries were ok.  They were pretty greasy/oily and crunchy.  It felt like we got the bottom on the fried stacked.  We had an order of it in our meal along with a side, this is why I tasted a difference; not cool.  Our waiter sucked.  He brought us an extra side of ketchup per my friend's request.  I didn't know she already asked him that so I told the waiter to bring 3 more or to bring a bottle.  He said they don't have bottles and laughed.  I wasn't kidding because I love ketchup.  He said he'd bring it but never did.  Then I asked this other worker to bring it.  He was the guy who filled our water cups.  He said he'd bring it, but never did.  Finally I saw another waiter and asked him and he brought one..booo.The place is alright..."
769,"Good food, great service, fun atmosphere. The mussels melt in your mouth. Order extra bread to soak up the delicious wine sauce!  On the specials menu, the Alaskan char was described as somewhere between salmon and trout. Luckily I love both.  It had the flavor of a mild lean salmon filet but the texture of buttery trout.  Served over a potato leek puree, it was delightful.  The portion was enough for two people, but I managed to finish it all.  The garlic spinach was nothing to write home (or here) about.  Sadly, no room for dessert.  The waiter had perfect timing, and was unhurried, friendly, gracious, and helpful.Sitting on the patio, the fountains across the street provided spectacular visuals.  In between the choreographed water art, people-watching took center stage.My only criticism was the hostesses were a little snotty and the bar service was a bit disorganized.  Arrived about 15 minutes late and they acted very irritated and wouldn't promise seating.  Waited another 15 minutes to get the bartender's attention.  Finally, the restrooms on the casino floor (there were none in the restaurant) were trashed with broken fixtures, paper and garbage everywhere, and a long line.  Regardless, I would go back in a heartbeat.Bon appetit!"
770,"As a person suffering from Celiac Disease, I was sad knowing that I would have to pass on ""french"" bread at a premiere french restaurant.  I was delighted to find out Gabi's had a special gluten free menu of dishes including fresh made gluten-free bread just for me!  The food was amazing, the server friendly and the atmosphere relaxed.  I would HIGHLY suggest getting reservations ahead of time for outside seating in the evening, so that you can watch the spectacular Orchestrated Fountain show across the street at the Bellagio throughout your meal. We will definitely return to this place everytime we go to Vegas!"
771,"A wonderful little restaurant with an unassuming facade, you could literally just walk by it and not even realize what you're missing.We came to the Paris in hopes of hitting up the famous buffet at Le Village but when we walked all the way there, we saw that the line to get in was even longer than to ride on Space Mountain.Pass.And after a night of binge drinking, my boyfriend and I decided that we didn't really want to do the buffet thing anyway. We were way too hungry and lazy and to be honest, just wanted to sit our asses down and be served. So we walked around looking for other places to dine that weren't so packed when we discovered this cute little restaurant hiding in the corner. We got an amazing table outside on the patio on the most gorgeous Vegas day. It was already a fantastic start to a delicious meal. The service was great too. Our waitress was very cute and so friendly, she made us feel right at home. We started with their Fruit Bouquet, which I had seen on several other tables. It was a beautifully carved cantaloupe filled with melon, grapes and pineapple that came with sides of creme fraiche, mint syrup and brown sugar. YUM. A perfect way to start breakfast. The fruit was so fresh and the little accompaniments paired perfectly. I personally loved the pineapple with the mint syrup and the cantaloupe with the creme fraiche. For our entrees my bf chose the Egg, Bacon & Cheese crepe with some added avocado on top. I chose the special Benedict of the day which came with spinach, tomato and bacon on a toasted sourdough muffin with a chive hollandaise. We also had to get a side order of the frites, they just looked so good!Everything was absolutely delicious. The crepe was perfectly cooked, really melted in your mouth. The cheese was chewy while the crepe was delicate, and the egg and bacon rounded all the flavors out very nicely. The avocado that my bf added also was a nice touch!My benedict was very good, the eggs were cooked perfectly which is a huge plus. Almost every benedict I get at a restaurant has over-cooked poached eggs, but these were nice and runny. Mmm! They weren't kidding about the 'toasted' muffin though. Mine was definitely a little more well-done than I would have liked but it was still yummy. I loved the muffin because it had a really distinct sourdough taste that went well with the rest of the Benedict flavors. The frites were also tasty. We could barely finish just one order because it was so big. Don't be fooled, it looks all cute and small in that little paper cone but it seems practically bottomless. Keep in mind though these are not typical fries, they are very thinly cut and fried until crispy then topped with a good amount of salt. If you like really crispy potatoes then you will love these. Otherwise, if you want regular french fries don't bother. Definitely a great experience for both of us and we were both so lucky to come on such a beautiful day. Will definitely try to come back next time I'm in town!"
772,"Good food, service, and ambiance.  The price is right too.  Great place."
773,"In peu de Paris en Vegas...Viva FranceThe view from this outside patio area is one of the most fabulous in VEGAS IF you are into the STRIP!And I am.We were there during the day.I am sure the nighttime view is beyond amazing considering you are directly across from the fountains from the Bellagio...Not possible to make reservations for the patioFirst come first seated.go at an off time, sign up and YES you can wait just outside the front doors and the ""buzzer"" still works, even though they say it doesn't...I loved the mussels with the fries, and the huge French Onion Soup with melted cheese.My GF had the Salmon Salad, perfect.Not cheap, but well worth the quality food, good service and magnificent view"
774,"Just getting around to writing a review for this great spot.   The view is spectacular from the patio (we always get patio seating here) and a great place to just sit and people watch.  My husband and I dined here for about 3 hours just ""noshing"" on several different appetizers plus drinks.  This is a great way to spend the afternoon and everything we ordered was perfectly prepared and delicious.  We both had the soup du jour which was LOBSTER BISQUE. It was truly wonderful but we ordered a shot of sherry for the soup, which to our disappointment should have been in the soup to begin with.  Not a big deal since everything else was over the top.We went back for dinner and sat on the patio again.  And again, the food was memorable as was the ambience.More recently 2 of my friends and I had lunch here and we all loved it so much we've decided to make this our favorite lunch spot.One ordered the LEMON THYME SALMON.  She said it was the best salmon she'd ever had and I had to agree.  It was just a bit rare in the center which is what it's supposed to be and the lemon thyme flavor shone through.  The other One ordered a steak, done medium rare and she said it was perfect.  I didn't taste the steak but she loved it.I ordered one of my favorite dishes TROUT GRENOBLAISE.  Wow.  It was absolutely fabulous.  The sides we ordered were shared and there wasn't a thing we could find to complain about here.Service was a little on the slow side but it was crowded and we were in no hurry.    If you want patio seating next to the railing you need to get there just before they open so you can be seated among the first.  It's worth it just to sit and watch the fountains and the throngs of people walking by.   Take your time here."
775,"I'm a fan. We always go here when we're in Vegas. The food is consistently good, you can sit outside, and the prices are reasonable."
776,"This place is pretty awesome.  The view outside of the Bellagio fountains is really really good.  Appetizers and main dishes are great.  I am not a huge fish person, but the fish, especially the special was really tasty.  Service is very good too, our server was super enthusiastic, I wish I could remember her name.  I was horrendously jetlagged but still had a great time.  The place has good food quality, location, and service for the price.  It's not an extremely refined restaurant, but is definitely a great value and worth eating at for dinner."
777,"Went for a coffee and breakfast one early morning. Cool air outside, little noise on the street (YET) and had a wonderful one hour experience. I do not know if I could sit on the patio during lunch or dinner....just too damn much noise from the street."
778,"This place is great for people who need to eat Gluten Free, but still want a nice dinner on the strip. Great selection on their gluten free menu, but not much for vegan. The servers were very understanding and accommodating. And you can't beat that view! Eat on the porch and watch the Bellagio water show every 15 minutes!"
779,"This is one of my strip favorites.  I've had the pleasure of lunch and dinner and each experience has been delightful.  I enjoy the Hanger steak in the late afternoon...I recommend to go during the 4 o'clock hour or so in the spring season best to wait for patio seating since it is directly across The Bellagio fountain show.  Moreover, the hanger steak is excellent with a side of frites and also paired with nice bodied red wine preferrably a pinot noir.  Don't forget the chicken liver pate prior to the main course!  Also don't hesitate to sit and dine for at least a couple hours, enjoy the scenery and sip on wine. Enjoy!"
780,Fantastic view at night for the fountains @ the bellagio. Affordable food and decent wine selection and thanks to our waitress i asked for a red bordeaux and she recommended me a good one.
781,"holy crap this place is amazing!! ive always seen it and it never occurred to me that i should try it.  my bf took me here for my bday dinner.  the yelp reviews (pictures) looked pretty good, so why not?  first off, im not a steak person...at all.  but i went out on a limb and ordered the filet mignon with the bordelaise  sauce.  it was the best freaking slab of meat ive ever had! i told everyone i knew that if steak was like this all the time, i would order it every where i went!!  bf got the hanger steak and a beer.  i got a French martini too.  our server was so nice and so were the hostess's.  we ended up getting there 45 mins early, but they seated us right away.  we could even see the bellagio show from our seats.  oh and you MUST make space for dessert.  if you love bread pudding, you HAVE TO HAVE TO order it.i cant wait to go back and check out their brunch!!"
782,"Ate here in March and love it. This was not our first time and won't be our last.  This is a ""must eat"" on almost every Vegas trip we make.The ambience is great - inside, wonderful dark wood, comfortable. There is also outside patio seating, so you have a view of the Bellagio fountains and the Strip.Food - just simply amazing. The trout - awesome!  I had the seared scallops over a bed of pureed califlower and spinch and it was so good.  My DH who does not like scallops, loved them. He had the steak (flat iron I think) and liked it, but regreted not ordering the trout.  They have a duck confit dish that is wonderful as well.There wine is reasonably priced and so good.  The bread - amazing. Service great.  I reallyl can't say anything bad - the prices are reasonable too."
783,"Went here for dinner on a Friday night with a group of 12 guys and we all thought it was great.  They accommodated our group without any problem.  Very convenient location at the Paris hotel, right on the Strip.  It's a French steakhouse - which is different than an American or Italian steakhouse.  Basically every steak just comes with frites, and there are limited other options.  I had the filet which was really good.  Only complaint I heard all night was that the lobster tail add-on was pretty small and thus not worth it.  They give everyone fresh French bread when you sit down, which was amazing.  Tons of good French wines available, plus a full bar.  Service was excellent and prices are very good, especially for on the Strip in Vegas.  I'll definitely be coming back in the future!"
784,"The place is aight. The location is pretty good, Paris casino right in front of the Bellagio fountains. We were first at the city center restaurants and everything seemed pretty pricey so of course I yelped restaurants in the area and came across this one. The prices were like a normal restaurant. About $15 a plate. There was a wait for the outdoor area so we just decided to sit inside. The food was good, in my opinion but the others I was with thought it could be better. The other reviews complimented the waiters but ours wasn't that great. We had to ask a busboy for help. It's all good cuz we took it out of his tip :)"
785,"Masayuki threw up after eating at this place. The waitress recommended an ""light"" dish that was really cheesy (the warm chicken and brie sandwich). It was too much and too rich for him and he threw up! But he really liked the onion soup! I had the seafood crepe. I can tell the shrimp was really fresh because I had allergic reaction after eating it (allergy to fresh shrimp).It was good though; especially the sauce and there were peas inside the crepe. I thought the shrimp and scallop would be inside the crepe but it was actually outside."
786,"The food is simply excellent and true to French bistro fashion. The prices are very reasonable, particularly for Vegas standards and the patio is a great place to sit and enjoy a meal. On the minus side, the wait staff is frazzled, so you won't get the attention you should, and the dining room is cramped and very noisy (again, bistro/brasserie style). Still, one of our musts every time we end up in Vegas."
787,"Whoot whoot. While we didn't sit outside on the patio, we sat in there nice atrium in the strong sunshine. It was a nice end of the trip meal...They have a Bloody Mary Bar. We sat near it. You order whatever vodka you want and they bring you a huge glass of it. You then take this glass and bring it over to the Bloody Mary Bar. You can choose tomato juice or clamato juice... you can then add an assortment of olives, there are pickled beans, fresh horseradish... oh and they have pepperoni sticks. I saw people walking away with their glasses filled to the brim and with side plates filled with extras. After placing our order with our wonderful waiter, he brought us soft baguettes with butter. Our waiter was so friendly and so engaging. He was fairly attentive for a busy Sunday. He made suggestions and knew a lot about the menu. He also brought me refills of coke without me even having to ask. We got there during brunch, but I had lunch. Hmm, while my friends ate burgers, eggs benny and corned beef hash, I had the country pate and the warm frisee salad with bacon. Sigh. I could have sat here all day. The pate was really good. It was firm and the top was covered in bacon. It came with some toast, cornichons and a big dollop of grainy mustard. I didn't really need the mustard and shamefully ate most of the pate with my fork. Yum yum. My frisee salad was nicely tossed with the right amount of vinaigrette. I love the soft, runny poached egg. I love breaking that yolk and seeing the golden thickness coat the curly lettuce. Oh, and there is bacon. Yes, and lots of it."
788,"I've been here twice, and both times blew my mind.  Ok...the first time was for my brother's bachelor party.  We can't talk about what went down...I might get some people in trouble...but the steak I had was amazing.  It had some kind of dijon sauce...sooooo good.!!!!  Anyways...they treated our party of 15 like royalty and I was very pleased that I chose them as the place to take my bro for that special night.  I also went there for lunch about a week ago, and had the ahi tuna burger...it was ridiculously good...everything about it...oh yeah...and Holly Madison was sitting right next to us the whole time...kinda cool...but whatever...the service has been very good every time...if you're in Vegas...go here...Oh yeah...and the view of the Bellagio fountains is pretty awesome too..."
789,"TIP: Sit outside! You get to sit next to the strip and see the Belagio hotel right across the street. I can imagine how beautiful it must be for dinner service.Hubby and I had been pondering about a breakfast buffet in Vegas but opted out since we didn't want to spend $25-$35 at Paris buffet this time around. Well I got the sweet dish: fresh-made crispy waffles served with bacon in the mix with chocolate sauce on the side. Is your mouth watering yet? The waffle was satisfying but it wasn't the best waffle I've had. (Bouchon chicken and waffles are still my favorite.) The hubby opted for the savory dish which consisted of his favorite item: corned beef hash. Luckily for me, I taught my hubby to eat poached eggs and that was also included on top of the hash. Delicious...just add some hot sauce and your set.Coffee is refillable and served unlimited. Service was great. Thanks Mon Ami Gabi for an overall great experience."
790,"Quaint and bustling place with a great atmosphere especially with outside seating. That said, RELATIVE to all the great food in Las Vegas, the food was not all that memorable. We tried two types of salads and a steakburger. They serve small portions so go if you want a dainty, casual, and somewhat classy meal.Three star does not mean I disliked this place, it's just a measure of how impressed I was relative to other restaurants in the area."
791,"what an amazing breakfast!came here with my boyfriend and my parents: i got the french onion soup (i was hung over -_-;; couldn't really eat lol), my boyfriend got the french toast (substituted the blueberries for strawberries and got regular syrup) i'm not a french toast fan...but man i had a bite and it was so good! probably the best french toast i tried! my mom got the skinny apple pancake...it was good, HUGE, thin, crispy...delicious! my dad god the spinach and green veggie omelette...it was really good! the hashbrowns were AMAZING!the service was great...our server was so attentive and she made sure that we had our drinks refilled w/out asking (ALWAYS A PLUS!) i can't wait to go back for lunch or dinner!one thing though...one of the hostesses...she looked like she got punched by a bus...very upsetting to see her face. she looked so upset and angry it really made my hangover worse. ugh she didn't say hi, smile, she just looked like shit...UGH i hate it when they put people like that in front of the restaurant...it makes people not want to eat there!"
792,"This is where I ate the most perfect, melt in your mouth, medium rare filet mignon with merlot butter. Holy effing cow was it delicious I nearly cried when it came to the last bite. Steak is definitely their specialty but not the only one, the seafood is also pretty amazing as proven by my boyfriend's sea bass daily special.We started the meal with a small amusebouche, bread and butter, and the baked brie. The honey coupled with the roasted garlic made the brie a winner. Next came my steak, the best filet I've ever eaten, and it simply and perfectly came with Mon Ami Gabi's famous French fries. Being a French restaurant, we of course stayed for dessert and ordered the creme brûlée and a macchiato. For the quality and deliciousness of the food, friendly and attentive service, and atmosphere, this is one of the best deals and best kept secret on The Strip! The only reason I give it 4 stars is that it is a little cramped, and there aren't any restrooms inside the restaurant (my boyfriend and I felt people were walking on top of us the whole time, and you have to go outside into the casino's restroom if you have to go). Besides that, it is still my favorite place to eat and I am definitely coming back!"
793,"It's delightful. This place is one of my favorite ""touristy restaurants"" in town. I always recommend it for lunch or brunch to people who are visiitng or looking for a staycation on the strip. The food is delicious and they have amazing views of the fountains and the pedestrians walking by. Great place to people watch with a glass of wine in one hand and a crepe in the other. Some of my favorite menu items are the steak sandwich with pomme frites and the savory crepes. Absolutely delicious. You can't really go wrong here. Definitely worth the effort."
794,"The atmosphere is beautiful in here- and this is why you should come.  Whomever designed this restaurant derserves a big kudos.  I love the lighting, the tile, and the glass ceiling by the patio.  I love how you can see the Bellagio fountains from the patio-so perfect, and how they remember to keep you warm here with their patio heaters. :)  It loses a star because the food taste just ""average"" to me.  I've been here twice.  Once I got an apple salad that left me still hungry (I think it's meant of more of an appetizer than an entree), the other time I got the Classique steak (my husband and I share the appetizers of the mac&cheese, and sweet potato soup), everything was ""just okay.""  Big portions but ordinary tastes.  The bread was amazing through, and bread is important to me!  The warm bagette with carrot dressing (sounds gross but trust me, it was fantastic).  I might try this place for breakfast sometime after reading the reviews here."
795,"We decided to eat here rather than at an equal to lower rated restaurant where the meal would cost 2-3x more. There are so many restaurants where it's easily $100/person, and who knows if it's really going to be worth it. Coming from SF bay area we get plenty of good eats, and I hate forking out a ton of money for average food and a ""me too"" environment. This place was oozing cuteness, and personality. Like a vibrant french cafe.  The service was very good, attentive, helpful. The food was great.  We had the english pea soup special which was absolutely great, and I had the scallops, hubby had the skate wing. Both were delish but the scallops were best. You get 5 huge scallops and lots of veggies for like $20. The quality of the food ingredients and freshness of the seafood was apparent, and it was such a good value. We each had 2 glasses of wine and were out of there for like $100 or so.  Would definitely recommend this place for dinner (and I bet brunch would be great too!)."
796,"This is a great value restaurant.  Just nice enough for a business dinner.  But still casual enough to take the kids,  Excellent food and service,  Wine list is weak."
797,"I was quite excited when I learned that Mon Ami Gabi served breakfast and brunch. We had eaten here, years ago, for lunch and dinner - and both were good experiences.Even though it was a little chilly, we opted to have our Saturday breakfast outside on the patio (they have heaters). The menu looked great. I appreciated that they offered some non-breakfast items (french onion soup, spinach salad, etc.) in addition to the more typical breakfast items. The breakfast items ranged from omelettes to chocolate and bacon waffles to sweet and savory crepes.We decided to play it somewhat safe and go with an omelette. I liked that their omelettes had what felt like a French-twist (brie, etc.). When our omelette arrived, everything looked delectable. The omelette came with hash browns, green beans (yeah, green beans), and toasted bread. We also ordered a side of bacon. The omelette was very light and fluffy - cooked perfectly. While it had a lot of spinach, I tasted little cheese. And despite being advertised as ""spinach and green vegetables"", it was just spinach. 2 stars. The green beans (seriously, green beans) were outstanding. I don't know what they were cooked in (there seemed to be a hint of garlic?), but they were awesome. 5 stars. The hash browns were also great. Good balance of crispy and soft - and there were a lot of flavors going on. Definitely no need for hot sauce or ketchup or anything. 4 stars. The bacon looked amazing, but was a bit of a let down. The glaze was incredible, but the bacon itself wasn't crisp enough (despite the menu calling it ""crispy bacon"") and was too fatty. 2 stars.The drinks were nothing special. The mimosa was just your standard mimosa. The bloody mary bar (they bring you the glass and vodka, you visit the ingredient station and create your own drink) was pretty eh. They had standard bloody mary mixes in ice, ok selection of hot sauces, no worcestershire sauce, not enough tongs for everything, etc. 2 stars.I so want to give this place 4 stars, but based on our particular meal, I just can't. However, the service and ambiance are definitely 4 stars. And I think we may just have ordered the wrong thing. As we were walking out, we were both drooling over some of the plates at the other tables. We will definitely be back here for breakfast / brunch and hope to eat something better."
798,"This is a perfect place to eat especially if you like some French cuisine.  I would recommend sitting on the patio to people watch and you get a front row seat to the waterfall show across the street.  Their fries are amazing.  I had escargot and it was cooked to perfection.  The french bread is nice and chewy.  If you love martinis, they have a make your own martini bar inside too."
799,"Eating dinner at the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant was one of the highlights of my Vegas vacation.  The dinner prices were extremely affordable (especially considering the location and the pricing of other nearby restaurants) and the food was excellent.  Each couple in our group had to pay $100, but this included 2 bottles of wine (approximately $64).  You can't really get much better bang for the buck on the Las Vegas strip.  I will say that the Sea Scallops were perfectly cooked and my mouth is watering just thinking of it.  The escargot was also very tasty (although I am admittedly not an expert on that particular appetizer).  And of course, as you will see from other reviews, the views from the patio (where we ate) are spectacular.  Not only do you get amazing views of the Bellagio fountains, but you also get spectacular views of the heart of the Vegas strip.  This would be an ideal place to bring a date or loved one, as the location is about as romantic as it gets.  It was a tad bit cold at night when we went, but the outside heaters helped a little (although if you sit near the street you will be outside the range of the heaters).  The one slight downside is that it did take a while for our food to come to our table, although to be fair they were jam packed.  Highly recommended and I would definitely go back again on my next trip to Vegas!"
800,"Wonderful location right on the strip across the street from the Bellagio. We stopped here for a late dinner after a long day of shopping. Even though it was busy we were able to get a seat on the patio, right on the strip.The food was really good, we started with the shrimp cocktail - the shrimp were huge and cooked to perfection. I had the Roast Chicken and Frites which was very tender and tasty. I liked the crispy skinny ""frites"". Could've used a little more veggies to balance out the plate, but other than that it was all good."
801,"I had Mon Ami Gabi as my last meal in Vegas. We went b/c some of my suitemates went there from their last visit. It topped the trip off perfectly as we spent the afternoon eating and chatting away at a window side table in this little bistro! I was thankful we got indoor seating since the weather had been really windy outside!For Hors D'Oeurves we had:  Escargots de BourgogneThis was a bit against my will but group majority prevailed. My previous encounter with snails were not pleasant but I decided to give them another shot. Honestly I couldn't really taste much of it as it was masked in the garlic herb sauce. It was just a chewy bit of something that I swallowed down. I liked to dip the baguette into the garlic herb sauce tho that was really yum-O. Entree: Trout GrenobloiseI liked the flakiness of the fish.The pan-sear or however the skin was prepared was great. It was very crispy! It was mildly seasoned and hinted at the fish's natural flavor which was good. Overall i really liked it. It was light and the green beans that came with it were cooked nicely. So there was the frites that came along in a cup and they were super yummy and quite addicting. Thinner than fries and maybe even than potato chips.at Last!1! time for Dessert!: Profiterole Trio A.K.A Cream puffs! They were super good!!! It was napoleon style as we had vanilla, chocolate and strawberry filled centers. I loved the chocolate/ fudge sauce that was drizzled on them. The flavors were very concentrated and they put me to shame to the kind of cream puffs I had made in HS french class. Much better than Beard Papa too that has commercialized and supersized the cream puff. I def loved the atmosphere of this place and though it's on the pricier side, its a treat to come here with friends and check it out for one of the fancier meals one can have in Vegas."
802,"We came here for our anniversary dinner on May 1st 2010, I'm writing this review a little late.The only good thing about this place is the view of the Bellagio fountain while you eat... now the bad parts.- So loud I couldn't hear my wife talking across the tiny table on our anniversary!- There were as many kids here as adults, and running around free like it was freaking Chuck E Cheese- The service was terrible, we waited 45 mins for our food, and my steak came out cold and raw like they just took it from the fridge.  Water refill?  what refill?- Extremely over-priced mediocre quality food.If you want a romantic, or quiet, or intimate, or tasty French restaurant go to Pamplemousse, don't waste your time here."
803,"this restaurant holds a special place in my heart, whenever we're in Las Vegas, we dine here. we see My Friend, Gabi at least once a year and are never ever disappointed."
804,"My friends & I came to Vegas to reunite & celebrate our five years of friendship that began in France.  Well, what better place to celebrate than a French cafe.  We went for lunch and enjoyed our quiche lorraines, French bread, and waters.  The spinach on the side was to die for.  Service was great.  We were a bit dehydrated from our flights & going out the night before and were chugging the water.  Our waiter must have filled each of our glasses 5-6 times."
805,"We always walked by the restaurant, always wondered how its food was like, always admired those who dined there looking so relax and happy, always wanted to give it a try one day. And we did this time! We were there for lunch, requested an outdoor table because the weather was great and the view was good. We were told the wait time was 30 minutes and were given a vibrator to come back later. As we walked away from the restaurant, one of the receptionist called my name and said a table was ready for us now. We were surprised and happy that we did not need to wait. I found this interesting drink on the menu called ""Frangria"" and ordered a jar. It was like a French-style Sangria and it was good. My sister and mom did not enjoy it much but the drink was great to start my day. We liked the bread they served. It was hot and fresh. We ordered a Prime Rib sandwich, a Chicken and Brie sandwich, and a Seafood Crepe. Prime Rib sandwich was good. Its meat was very tender and juicy. Chicken and Brie was a little sweet, perhaps the sweetness was from the apple slices? I liked my Seafood Crepe. Shrimps and scallops were big, juicy, and cooked to perfection. However, the sauce was a little too plain and they could have put things other than green peas inside the crepe. For each plate, it came with a tiny side salad and I really like the salad dressing. We did not order dessert because our entrees were very fulfilling. I will definitely go back again because this place is perfect for a relaxing morning."
806,"The best overall meal I had on The Strip was at Mon Ami Gabi.We were seated pretty quickly outside on the patio.The service was great- our waitress was such a doll.They had a gluten-free menu and gluten free bread! Steak Frites were fantastic, so was the trout.Desserts were super-yummy!The view was fantastic and the outdoor seating was comfortable and warm (with heaters in late March). We just walked through the inside-dining room, but it was a beautiful room."
807,"Let me start off by saying that is was a beautiful day...70 degrees sitting outside under a table umbrella with the heat lamp warming my shoulders.  Perfect Tuesday afternoon and the wait was only 30 min. to sit outside.  Inside there was immediate seating for those that didn't want to wait.  Our server was very nice and the food came within 20 min.  The view of Bellagio and the passerbys on the sidewalk was great!  We ordered  warm brie cheese with roasted hazelnuts and garlic as an appetizer.  It was served with toast and it was delish!  For lunch I had warm chicken and brie sandwich with sliced green apples.  WOW!  SOOO good!  It came with stringy french fries that was light and crisp.  Overall, very very happy  :)"
808,The best service and the most outstanding filet and salmon!Such a treat to find a unique restaurant that is in the heart of the tourist crowd. We will definitely go back when we're in town!!!
809,Great bread pudding
810,"Great gluten-free menu - they even have gluten-free bread. The service was slow, but the food was great. The creme brûlée was just all right."
811,i always come here once a year for the steak bordelaise n pomme frites!! Their fries is the only one i would eat.. they are so crispy n tasty.escargot is good.. for adventurous foodie... n not for the faint hearted... or country bumpkin who's not open minded to try anything at least once.the pate is good.. the roasted butternut squash soup is good...
812,"Disappointed!I came here with friends for lunch and was looking forward to sitting in the patio. Too bad the wait was an hour so we decided to sit inside. Of all the available seats, we were seated next to the door that had a draft. Luckily, the server allowed us to move over one table. Warm bread was provided when the server came along. We started off with Escargots de Bourgogne ($10.50). It was described as ""oven-roasted snails, garlic-herb butter."" It was decent. NOT enough butter for my taste and a bit too much garlic. However, dipping the hard bread in the sauce was still okay. Unless you're really craving for escargot, I'd pass on this dish.I ordered the Prime Steak Sandwich cooked Medium w/au jus, mustard mayo, caramelized onions ($13.95) and that came with their ""signature hand-cut frites.""  I think I should have ordered this medium-rare because the steak was not as tender as I would like. Overall, it was a simple sandwich and the sauces complimented well. Their frites were definitely different from what I'm use to. Like most of the reviewers have said, these are borderline potato chips! My friend and I kept calling them a TEASE. It was too thin to fulfill us...I would have given this place TWO STARS but the server was engaging and attentive. Sooo.....unless I was going to be seated in the patio with a few Bloody Marys in hand, I doubt I'd come back here for lunch."
813,"Every time I'm in Vegas I have to eat here. The roasted chicken was great   This time escargot, carrots, mashed potatoes were outstanding. The filet was out of this world. I gave it 5 stars because of my meal, yet there were a couple things they need to work on. The mac & cheese lacked taste and was very dry.  The scallops needed some flavor they were flat.  These were dishes my wife had. Overall I will go back again and again!"
814,Mon Ami Gabi is one of my favorites. This evening I had the vinaigrette salad with sweet bacon and poached eggs....so very good. A delicious tender steak with fresh herb butter and frittes. So enjoyable while watching the fountains of Bellagio. Ignore some of these cruel reviews and trust this review.
815,"Mon Ami Gabi is a great choice for a nice restaurant in Vegas without going into fine dining and breaking the bank.I came here on my first trip to Vegas with my girlfriends because my friend really likes this place.  We sat on the patio and watched the sun go down.  Keep in mind this place has MONEY locale for its great view of the Bellagio fountain show.  It's a little blocked by palm tress but its as good as its going to get for not standing in front of it. Plus this gives you something to do while you watch it.Everyone ordered steaks while I ordered a Lemon-Thyme Seared Salmon with orzo, peas, leeks, spinach, lemon butter.  The salmon was cooked well but it was...salmon.  Most places don't usually do a lot with salmon but it was plated with a very nice creamy orzo and vegetables. It was a good combination because it brought a little more to the salmon.  Overall though, the orzo and vegetables still stood out over the salmon.All in all, Mon Ami Gabi makes nice food at a reasonable price for Vegas.  We will be back this summer as my friend really wants to go again."
816,"I would only come back here for the French onion soup wich was a big portion and not too salty.  I love Mac n Cheese and is always a must order, but not from here it tasted like something from out of a box.  The ambiance was nice and the patio next to the outdoor seating is a nice place to have lunch.  Cant say nothing else for the food it was just eehh."
817,"I was so excited to try the place because walking by the restaurant, the smell of the food wafting out of the restaurant smelled divine and I was craving fish. The atmosphere is quite cozy and chic. It is quite busy so service wasn't terrible but not as good as it could've been. I ordered the Escargots de Bourgogne and the Skate Wing. I had not had escargot in a really long time, so I HAD to try it but it was quite a disappointment. The garlic herb sauce for the escargot was extremely buttery to the point where I could feel the butter after wiping my mouth. Definitely not appealing. And the escargot was a bit on the chewy side. When the skate wing arrived the aroma was intoxicating. The texture was very light (similar to a tilapia type fish) and the flavors wasn't too overwhelming. I was not a fan of the capers (a bit on the tart side which was a little off putting with the dish) that came with the fish. The chips (made in-house) were extremely de-lish! Probably would buy a whole bag if I could.For fish, this place is fantastic. Great atmosphere. Would definitely want to go back to try some other dishes as I'm a huge fan of french cuisine."
818,"6 girls and a really nice ""sex and the city"" feel breakfast.we didnt have to wait long and got seated outside. it was a little windy but they had heating lamps outside. we knew we wanted some mimosas and the waitress was nice enough to let us know that a bottle of champagne would be cheaper than  a glass each. Cool! i ordered the crab cakes egg benedict i think it was called, and it was really good. nice big pieces of crab and you can taste it really well. the egg was done just right and the hash browns!!! sooo goood. my friend had the chocolate bacon pancakes which were such a treat! really unexpected flavors and really yummy, more like dessert but it was delicious. others had the original eggs benedict and etc, but we were all quite happy and satisfied with our meal. I think it was $26 for each person with tip.will definitely come again! and try that onion soup!"
819,"Bad food at a beautiful location. Lesson learned, sit on the patio or go elsewhere. We made the mistake of coming here for the brunch food, which was on par with Denny's.It was a 45 minute wait for a table outside on a Saturday at 11am so we sat inside instead. We were seated near the entrance. The dining room was too dark. The tables were way too close together, other diners stepped all over us trying to sit down, and we didn't want to hear their NASCAR and Budweiser conversation.Our waiter took our orders, served our food, and checked once to make sure everything was okay. Other than that, he was completely forgettable. Oh, except that he corrected wifey's pronunciation of crêpe as ""crape"". *POP* goes the sound of the pretend-we're-in-Paris bubble.Our main complaint was the food, it was uniformly bad.The crêpe was served floating in a grainy béchamel sauce that tasted like raw flour and pretty much ruined it.The Croque Madame egg was overcooked (no runny yolk), cheese was congealed, and toast was dry.Our brunch came with a generous serving of french fries so thin they were nearly potato chips, and they were pretty tasty.The make-your-own Bloody Mary bar is genius and delicious, there's tons of fresh and pickled veggies, different stuffed olives, and different hot sauces to choose from. I would have liked a larger glass to get more good stuff in there, 1 shot of vodka and some ice filled half the glass. There was hardly any room to put all the goodies in. I did love that you can choose any vodka (goose please!)."
820,"Delicious food! Service was incredible, well orchestrated and very friendly. Our server was incredible and had great recommendations about the food and drink selection. The patio is really nice and a great place to people watch while having an incredible dinning experience."
821,"I absolutely love this restaurant in LV.  We have been enjoying it for probably 15 years.  While in LV we eat here almost every night.  The food is fabulous.  I usually have the steak classique.  The French fries are to die for.  Best ever.  This time I took a chance and had the fraisee salad,  yumm!   I have also had lunch and the sandwiches are awesome.  Breakfast wasn't that great.  Make a reservation it gets busy.  Oh and go at off times so you can enjoy the water show at Ballagio.  BTW the reservations are for inside only.  We were disappointed by this."
822,"Location, location, location!  That should be enough said, but based off the LOCATION, I gave it 5 stars.  Now, if it was based off of the crappy server we had.........  did I mention location?Food, eh, good enough, considering the...... location!A little overpriced for what you get, but the location is great!"
823,"My wife and I ate here before a show at the Paris. It was too cold to sit outside, but the bistro feel indoor was fine. House wine was reasonably priced and good (though I am not a connoisseur) and the warm loaf of French bread was delectable. French onion soup was rich with no shortage of onions or cheese.  I had the Beef Bourginon which was excellent. My wife's prime rib was huge, tender, and cooked to perfection. It was accompanied by creamy scalloped potatoes and al dente green beans. We each took 1/2 home for lunch tomorrow. By Vegas standards, the prices were reasonable, as we got out at under $100. We will return next time we're in town."
824,"DH and I dined here during our 2009 trip.  After that, it's on my must-dine list.  J'adore c'est restaurant!  I dined here during my recent trip.  This time I sat at the bar.  My server/bartender, #86, was great and very pleasant.  He helped me choose a great red wine to pair with my dinner.  My dinner was pretty simple, I ordered the steak frites.  I love that dish.  I think the herb butter they put on the steak is perfect!    I think the prices are very reasonable.  This was another great experience and I will be back on the next trip.  Next time I would love to sit outside.  5 stars for the service, ambience, food, drinks, and location!"
825,"Great location and prices. We went here for brunch, and was a bit underwhelmed. The food was just ordinary breakfast food for an inflated price. There are other more amazing places for cheaper, but it's good in a pinch."
826,"I have been traveling to Vegas since the mid 90's at least 2 or 3X a year for business and pleasure, and nothing compares to a meal at Mon Ami Gabi! Hands down this is one of my favorite places to dine when I am in town, and I can honestly say I have never been disappointed. This classic French bistro serves magnificent food in a wonderful atmosphere, and at a fair price. Thier position on the strip also offers a terrific view of the Bellagio.As soon as I boarded my flight from NY this morning my mouth was drooling with anticipation. Thier steak frites are absolutely amazing, and will melt in your mouth with orgasmic bliss. I knew that I would be dining alone tonight, so I did not even make a reservation as the bar area is a great spot to eat here, especially the one out facing the strip with a view of the Bellagio water show. I just winged it and ended up with a prime spot sitting and conversing with other single visitors in town enjoying a meal at the bar.I ordered  a glass of Pinot Noir, and chose the Steak Frites Bordelaise. Tender steak sliced thin, almost like a flank steak, with carmelized onions, and a red wine sauce ladeled over the top. Crispy and thin frites with just the right amount of saltiness accompanied the steak. I bit into the first bite and - OH -MY-GOD - I wanted to melt off my bar stool right then and there. The exquisite taste of the steak along with the carmelized onions just put a smile on my face the whole time I was there. I think everyone around me had the same look of satisfaction from what they were eating too. I went absolutely all piggy and finished every bite of steak and frites on the plate. I even soaked up the extra sauce on the plate with this amazing hot mini baguette of crispy bread they serve with the meal.It was all so good I totally ignored the booming sounds of the water show going on across the street. As I settled up the bill I was glowing in the aftermath of total satisfaction. Just a perfect place to have a great meal in a civilized atmosphere wether it be a date or a group. As I walked down the street back towards my casino hotel I felt as if I was floating two inches above the ground. Drool is already forming at the corner of my mouth writing this review!"
827,"I have eaten here about a half-dozen times. Once on New Years' eve in order to see the fireworks from the patio.The view from the patio is awesome! Across from the Bellagio and it's dancing fountains. Quintessential Las Vegas views down the boulevard in either direction. The patio of Mon Ami Gabi is truly the epicenter of Las Vegas.The decor is that of a Parisian French bistro one would find on the holodeck of the Starship Enterprise. Almost too perfect. But certainly very nice.The service was also very good. No real complaints.So why two stars? Because the food SUCKS and they know it. And they don't care.But the view from the patio at night is so compelling. It is worth the mediocre food. It really is. But gee, this place could be SO much more. So as a restaurant it gets 2 stars. But for a one-time reasonably priced dinner for a tourist, that patio view is worth the price of admission."
828,"Average food for an average price. No offense but the decorum of the restaurant totally gives off a vibe of a good classy time, but the food just doesn't measure up. Ordered the roasted chicken and fritas, the chicken came out too dry. Its a roasted herb chicken, every italian, american restaurant serves some version of this--so you can only manage my disappointment when they screw this up. It was too bland and to sort of juice/sauce component to go with the chicken. Do not get the trout. If you eat a lot of seafood, you will be able to tell instantly the fish is not up to par. The trout came out thin and too over dressed with the lemon and capers. Capers is incredibly overpowering thereby masking any fresh seafood taste this dish might have had. The Beef Bourguignon is also another version of beef stew, if that tickles your fancy. Bread came in paper bags... enough said. Service: moderate, there were times where it was impossible to flag down a waiter/ess."
829,Drinks were great.  I especially liked the French Martini.  I would recommend it to those looking for a sweeter drink.I've tried several of the steak frites and have enjoyed all of them.  It's a very large portion so you will not leave hungry.My coworker tried the escargot and scallops and he had good things to say about both.My biggest word of advice is to make reservations.  The wait for dinner during any day of the week tends to be pretty long.  I've had to wait between 30-45 minutes each time I've eaten there.
830,Good for brunch. Average service. No problems.
831,"Sunday Brunch is great here! Not nearly as expensive as dinner. I got the Steak & Eggs, and it was delicious. My boyfriend got a muffin and orange juice. He made me look like a pig! Oh well, I enjoyed! LOL!"
832,"Located right on the strip under the Eiffel Tower in Paris, this is a beautiful place to see and be seen in. If you're lucky enough to get a patio table (with a reservation AND come in early), you get a view of the Bellagio fountains, the Eiffel Tower, Caesars in the distance and beautiful lights. We sat inside, but still, the ambiance was there. The service very attentive, quick, and the server had great recommendations and favorites. We had:Steak Bearnaise - tender, Great sauce, excellent pommes fritesBeef Bourguignon - tender beef, wonderful sauce, buttered noodles (YUM)Burger - Good, came with pommes fritesOverall a good place to go for lunch/dinner. I would definitely recommend making a reservation so as to not wait, and again, get there early for a chance to sit outside and admire the passerby's and weather. We definitely wanted to come back here, but with such a short visit it makes for a good first night dinner to set the tone for your trip. They are known for their steak, their tender, flavorful steak. Have someone at your table try one if they like to share, or order one each and compare."
833,"The food here is wonderful. My friends and I arranged a set menu for our group of ten and everything was delicious. The people we spoke to before arriving were very nice and seemingly helpful... until we got to the restaurant and were told that it was ""policy"" that we could not do what we had been told twice before we could. (We were told that a couple of our group could go early to the restaurant and put our parties name down for the patio and then wait for the rest of our group to come at the reserved time). This type of customer service does a disservice to a restaurant that normally would have rated a 5 stars. Either tell your customers that something is not possible up front, or allow for special situations when they arise and be flexible.      It was not the way we wanted to start our dining experience."
834,"Great place - the yelp reviews are spot on. Sipped the house Chard, ate their steak sandwich with the ""Frites"" (awesome) and people watched during lunch from the outside patio."
835,This place was better 4 years ago when I was there.  There appetizers better than their main dishes.  Got to have the escargot and the oysters.
836,"Mon Ami Gabi has one of the best locations on the strip - right in front of the Paris, with a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountains.  Unfortunately, they don't take reservations for patio seating and the wait can get pretty long.  We gave up and opted to sit inside as a result.In terms of the food, I'd recommend the escargot, French onion soup, and duck confit.  I'd suggest skipping the pate.  Overall, food was OK, but definitely a bit overboard in sodium content.  Most of the dishes were great for the first few bites, but quickly became too rich / too salty.  Indoor seating is also extremely dark / stuffy (perhaps an interior remodel, additional lights, new furniture, etc. would help).  Overall, it's a nice place to eat if you're here for the view and manage to snag an outdoor table, but I'm not sure if I'd go out of my way to come back."
837,"I always recommend this restaurant to people that want to experience fine dining in Vegas, but do not want to break the bank. Food is exceptionally good and reasonably priced. If you're planning on ordering seafood for your entree, try the skate. You will not be disappointed."
838,"Man, my list of restaurants I must go to every time I'm in Vegas is getting too close to capacity!  I tried Mon Ami Gabi for the first time last weekend.  The bread.  My God, the bread.  They give you a mini-baguette of hot French bread (free) with butter and a little plate of vinegary shredded vegetables. (We were given one plate of apple slaw, and one plate of carrot.  Both were good.)  The bread is heaven, and they didn't even make a face when we asked for more!We ordered the warm brie appetizer, onion soup, caesar salad, crab cake, and a side of frites.  As a vegetarian, I was a bit worried there wouldn't be enough options for me, but there were plenty.  They have salads, soups, and a variety of vegetarian sides (like mac and cheese, which I will be getting next time), along with a ""vegetable platter"" entree - doesn't sound very awesome, but who knows.The brie was amazing.  I will be recreating it at home shortly.  Warm brie with honey, cracked black pepper, and roasted garlic cloves.  Perfection.The onion soup was also good, my only complaint is that it was too cheesy.  Sure, I love cheese, but I'd like some soup with my soup too.Caesar salad was nothing special, and at $8, I won't be ordering it again.  I know, I know, Caesar salads generally aren't special.  I mean, what can you do with lettuce, croutons, and dressing?  You can add capers, for one thing, as I do at home.  And, this salad was over-dressed.  Not horrible, but not worth it.My old man said the crab cake was the best he'd ever had, and he has tried crab cakes at many-a-restaurant.The frites = In-N-Out fry shnivelings.  And yes, that is a good thing.   They are AWESOME, a must-order!The service was quick and friendly, the wait was correctly quoted (30 minutes on a Sunday night), and the prices were reasonable.  The whole meal, including tax and tip, was only $60 (plus our two free loaves of bread....).  Nice!"
839,"I came here for lunch on a lovely Friday afternoon. It's directly across from the Bellagio hotel.. if you sit in the patio area you might be lucky enough to catch the beautiful water show! not sure, if you would be able to hear the music though. Location wise, it's one of the best places to eat on the strip! It's smack in the middle of the strip.Avoid sitting in the patio area in the summer time. It'll be too hot to eat in the scorching sun! Be sure to wear sunblock and sunglasses! :-)The food was really tasty... the bread was so buttery! :) I ordered steak and fries! My friend ordered crepe/scallops/shrimp... it was so creamy and so delcious. My other friend ordered the open face BLT with avocado.. it was a little messy to eat... but it was delicious nonetheless."
840,"I'm not sure how much this 1003rd review can add.  This place is great.  We had breakfast - crepes.  Thine eyes roll back from the memory of them still fresh in my brain.  Go there, now if you can."
841,"Strawberry waffles... Incredible.. Chicken and Brie sandwich incredible... Chicken, broccoli and cheese crepe close to terrible. Service is the best, scenery if you sit outside is prime reeeeeal estate.  I'd say this is a must go for Vegas first second or third timers."
842,"My fav restaurant we tried this past Vegas trip. Made reservations thru opentable unfortunately since patio seating is on a first come first serve basis we did not get to enjoy the Bellagio fountains while dining. As soon as we were seated we were given a loaf of french bread in a bag which we all thought was delicious so good that we asked for another. It was a ladies weekend out so we decided to share a few things so as not to get too full. Our order between the 4 of us: half order of mussels, asparagus soup, 2 Beef Bourguignons. I've been dying to try Beef Bourguignon only because I saw it in the movie Julia & Julia and it looked so good, if you're a fan of a hearty and flavourful beef stew I suggest you try this. It's a good thing I only ordered half of the mussels because I wouldn't have been able to finish a full order. I even shared with the other girls and we still couldn't polish it off, but it was definitely tasty. So tasty that I even took some of the bread and used it to sop up some of the broth, YUM! Both the Beef Bourguignon & asparagus soup were also good (which was the special of the day) I like this place so much that I want to take bf here when we come together. Unfortunately for girls ready to go to a club and dressed in heels the floor was pretty slippery. There were a few times that my heart skipped a beat because I slipped a bit. At first I thought I was the only one that noticed it. But when we were seated and I mentioned it to the girls they also had the same problem. I even had those grips on my shoes and I still slid, so be careful."
843,"What I loved about this place is that, when I had breakfast at street side, we were able to escape the smoke-filled casino and the bustling pace of the city.  We were just able to calm down and enjoy a nice breakfast.I ordered a green omelette with spinach and gruyere cheese.  My friends ordered quiche lorraine and eggs benedict.  The eggs benedict was the best dish of the three.  The other two items were kind of lacking in flavor.  Cost of entrees for breakfast runs between $8 and $15.  Definitely not bad!Quality of the food was merely okay...everything was good, but nothing was impressive.  Regardless, the location was great and our server was pretty sweet.   But because nothing really impressed me, I don't know if I'd come back to put down more money for lunch and dinner entrees.  But it's a cool place to come for breakfast....and to escape the strip without leaving it."
844,"Our server Joe handled our large and inexperienced diners with patience and a smile.  The only negative of the night was the surly and lazy hostess.  She was of no help to me when I checked in for my reservation.  My party had already been seated and she told me to go find them on my own.  Talk about horrible service.  However, for as large and as crowded this place is, they do a fantastic job of preparing well made food. I would advise on brushing up on your French wine knowledge if you plan on ordering wine here because the best finds are on the french wine list and that makes up 90% of the list. Go figure."
845,"I just had brunch here on Easter Sunday with my sister, brother-in-law, and a few friends.Service was fairly prompt and efficient, but not too friendly for the entire meal. Ironically/coincidentally, he became quite friendly and talkative at the end of the meal after we asked for the check.We were served freshly baked mini baguettes and a creamy butter. We also asked for some jam that seemed to be freshly made strawberry jam. All of the above were quite good.We ordered shrimp cocktail, a tuna salad dish, corned beef hash with poached egg, and brioche french toast with blueberries and macerated blueberry sauce.I was told the tuna salad was not fresh and barely edible. I personally ate the corned beef hash with a poached egg and the aforementioned french toast. I'd give the CB hash a 3.5; it was a bit mushy for me, I prefer to have my CB hash to be crisped in the pan to provide some texture and also to be seasoned a bit more. After adding some salt, pepper, and tabasco it was closer to a 4 star dish. The poached egg was OK, but not perfectly poached as so few ever are; would've preferred it to be a bit runnier.They used a nice thick brioche bread for the french toast, dipped it in a light custard before cooking. Topped it with a very light vanilla whipped cream and blueberries. Then served it with their macerated blueberry sauce (which is listed as maple syrup on their website's menu, but has no maple taste to it at all). I REALLY enjoyed this french toast, with the blueberry sauce it wasn't overly sweet. In fact, it was barely sweet at all. This french toast and the one stuffed with vanilla bean custard and fresh raspberries at Bellagio Cafe are the 2 best in town.If I was writing a review purely on the french toast here, I would give them 5 stars...but since I have to take everything else in to account they get a 4 for now until I try something else. I will definitely be back to eat the french toast again."
846,This place may have the most perfect patio location in Vegas!  It's located directly across from the Bellagio fountains.  You'll also have a nice view of the Eiffel Tower outside Paris.  Just make sure you come here before 6:00 or after 9:00 for dinner to avoid the hectic rush because they don't take reservations for the patio.I had the tenderloin steak with blue cheese spread and it was delicious.  They could do a little better by serving the streaks with some sort of fresh vegetable as opposed to frites.  The frites were a bit oily and got old after while.  Otherwise the food was excellent and the location cannot be beat.
847,"this was my second time eating here and it's still my favorite restaurant in Vegas.....I'm sure there are places with better food, or a better wine list, but i'm willing to bet they are buried deep inside a hotel or a casino and no matter how much you dress them up, and decorate the room, NONE can match the amazing ambiance of Mon Ami Gabi.  The food, staff, and atmosphere are unmatched anywhere in Vegas and truly reminded me of being in Paris FR. .   If you're lucky enough to get seating on the patio, or just inside near the windows you will be treated with the amazing water fountain show at the Bellagio every fifteen minutes.  It is most definitely the most romantic place to have dinner in Vegas.......you will not be disappointed."
848,"My bf and I had brunch here last Friday morning after arriving to Las Vegas from San Francisco.  We chose this place because of all the good reviews here, but we were definitely not impressed at all.  The food was mediocre but definitely compares to Denny's status with a marked up price.  The presentation wasn't even that great.  I had the ham and cheese omlette and my bf had the mushroom omlette and added chicken, which was very dry.  The ham on my omlette wasn't even ""fancy"" ham it's regular sandwich had from the grocery store.  The omlette menu was very simple and not a lot of options.  On a good note the hashbrowns were good and I might go back and try the crepes maybe that's there best dish."
849,"This place is amazing!!! Food is superb and the customer  service is out of this world. After a seating mix up the hostess reseated us in the best seat in the whole restaraunt with an amazing view of Bellagios. I had the skate that was delicious, and my mother had the infamous onion soup. The escargots were the best I ever had and I will be craving them  all week. Definitely one of the best places in Sin City to eat. The whole experience was breath taking."
850,"Great food !  My husband and i had the french onion soup ( It was great) , the oysters ( super fresh and good) and the steak sandwich ( very delicious) !  Has a great view of the vegas strip ! Overall a very nice place"
851,"The location takes the cake for this Lettuce Entertain You restaurant on the strip.  I would highly recommend a reservation; the downside is you can't get a reservation for the patio - the best patio on the Strip - so that's a long wait if you're wanting to do that.$260 got the four of us two mid-range bottles of red wine, one salad, four entrees, and one dessert.  I didn't think it was ridiculously overpriced, it's just I would rather eat someplace else.The atmosphere was kind of cheesey & touristy, and it was extremely dark in there.  Maybe I'm just getting old, but I could barely read the menu.  The first bottle of wine we got was just straight up rancid; once we asked about it, they were quick to replace it.  The French bread and garlic butter was really good to start out with.I had sea bass, it was just OK.  I think the concensus from the table was everything was just OK.  Maybe I expected more?Oh, except the bread pudding.  The white chocolate bread pudding was amazing."
852,"Had lunch here which was really good. The atmosphere of the restaurant is great, busy but comfortable. saw carrot top and george wallace at a table next to us.  went here for breakfast the next day which again was really good. We had reservations for lunch but did not for breakfast. For lunch we waited about 5 mins to be seated.  People who didn't have reservations were waiting for awhile so make sure to make reservations for lunch especially on the weekends. for breakfast we were seated inside with no reservations, which wasn't that bad, but sitting out in the patio is much better especially on a nice day."
853,"A perfect choice to enjoy delicious food with a great view. Their outdoor seating is ideal on a beautiful day. I started with a Caesar salad and my boyfriend had their French Onion soup. The salad was fine but not great, the soup was VERY cheesy. I'm not a big fan of onions, but it was quite tasty. Our starters were good, but I couldn't stop eating their delicious french bread! They also brought us some very good apple and fennel salad. We are both steak lovers and we had some of the best steak here. We opted for the filet mignon and it was the most tender steak ever! He ordered the Filet with Merlot butter and I ordered their Filet Mignon Au Poivre. Mine was great, but my boyfriend's steak was even better! Their frites were very good as well. Don't expect fries, they're more like chips. We each had a glass of Pinot Noir to accompany our meals. For dessert, I ordered their bread pudding which was moist and delicious and my boyfriend tried their Bananas Foster crepe. We also had their Cafe Gabi. It is coffee with Bailey's, Grand Marnier and Frangelico. Yum!This is definitely a place we plan on revisiting. Very soon!"
854,"On a perfectly mild sunny day in vegas, it was a great choice to eat on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi overlooking Las Vegas Blvd. As soon as we entered the restaurant from the casino entrance, from the dark interior, it was like stepping into a whole different world once we got seated on the patio. Usually when servers rattle off the specials of the day, it goes out the other ear for me. But after looking over the menu and half heartedly deciding on the spinach and gruyere omlette, I heard the server mention Bacon and Spinach Eggs Benedict and i was sold! Quiche Lorraine with bacon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=4Ua39HREZlvlYbEf3EP_ew for the dude and my friend got the dish i was thinking of originally http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=5luau0SKUmjSVfXBalxsMQ. We all agreed that my dish ended up being the best: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4JNXUYY8wbaaDmk3BPzlWw?select=T3jPSmE56xcETgTqjegttw.The quiche had a nice crust, but was kind of monotonous. (i love breakfast sides and this had none). The spinach omelette was ok- i enjoyed my omelette at Max Brenner much more. I've only had eggs benedict a few times elsewhere and i have to say this one was very yummy- the eggs were perfectly runny and the bacon (i believe it was applewood) was nice and crispy. We were too sweets wasted this time to order the pancakes, french toast etc, so next time i would like to try those or the steak dishes with a side of their onion soup!"
855,"I've been here 3 times because I love the outdoor seating, 1) because i love people watching 2) it's right in front of the Bellagio water showOf course the service is always great. The bread is  served nice and warm, and i do love french bread! Every single time I have been here I ordered a chopped salad because it is seriously the best chopped salad I've eaten, IN MY LIFE. The first 2 visits here the salad was different so they might have changed their menu because when I tried it a couple days ago it wasnt as good as i remembered. I am now eager to try something new, maybe breakfast? (If I could ever get my butt up in time)"
856,"We dined here recently on the 16th, a Saturday night, and it was absolutely fantastic.  We didn't have reservations, and were told that an inside table was about a 30minute wait, versus 90minutes for outdoor seating.  We chose to dine indoors.  I know that everyone is raving about the balcony seating, but the inside dining room was well appointed and perfect for a cozy dinner.  The bottles of their wines-by-the-glass sat close by at a serving station, and the server was generous with offering a taste before ordering a full glass.  The baguette in the bag was delicious and came accompanied by both butter as well as a yummy carrot compote.  The caesar salad was simple yet quite delicious.  But their famous steak frites are simply to die for.  I had the steak bordelaise, which came smothered in sweet caramelized onions and a red wine reduction, together with a mountain of frites that looked like shredded homemade potato chips -- airy and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  It was simply too much food to finish so I couldn't try any of their desserts.  Next time! And oh boy, absolutely no question about it there WILL be a next time! Each time I'm in Vegas, baby!"
857,Great food!  Blood Mary Bar.  done.
858,"Outside seating a must!  This is the best place on the Strip for People Watching, Great Food (the bread is to DIE for), attentive staff, view of the Bellagio Fountains and romantic lunches and dinners.  It is the first place I think of for business lunches and bringing family and friends who visit us here in LV.  Not too pricey for lunch and umbrellas to shade you in the summer, heaters in the winter.  LOVE IT."
859,"I went to Mon Ami Gabi last Thursday during a trip to Las Vegas, and I have to say I was blown away, once again!The food and daily specials never cease to amaze me, along with a superb selection of wines, both by the glass and the bottle. And do yourself a favor and try the chocolate mousse!!!!! You will absolutely melt as you are eating this amazing dessert!Mon Ami Gabi is always on my list any time I go to Vegas, and it will be on my list again when I return in October!"
860,"This place was excellent!! I always walk by this place every time I'm in Vegas and we finally decided to try it out for dinner this weekend.  You can make a reservation for the inside portion of the restaurant but the patio dining doesn't take reservations.  We decided that it was a nice evening and there was a cool breeze so we opted to wait it out and have dinner on the patio.  I'm glad we waited, it was really nice having the fountains in front of us throughout dinner and the weather was perfect! They do kind of squeeze you in there but that's understandable and we had a table for four for just the two of us so we had plenty of room.One problem I had was that there was some dude with a giant snake standing RIGHT in front of the restaurant the entire time.  He had a microphone and a little speaker and he was trying to charge people to take a picture with him and his snake the whole time....that got annoying real fast.The food was excellent!! We started out with a crabcake (they give you one medium sized crabcake) and it was pretty good, definitely not worth the $15 pricetag but I'm glad I tried it.  We shared a cup of the french onion soup too and it was pretty good.  I've never really been a big onion soup fan so I don't have much to compare it too but I heard it was good so we gave it a shot and I thought it was quite tasty.  I had the filet mignon and my fiance had the trout - I liked the filet way better but he said he thought the trout was just as good (I just like steak more than fish).  I really wanted to have dessert but I was just too full from everything else that I had to pass, but I'm sure it would have been delicious though.  I also opted out of having wine with dinner because I had been drinking all day, because you know, it's Vegas.  I'm definitely going to be back next time I'm in town and I'll probably have the filet again (it was just that good)!"
861,"Brunch here was great! A little bit pricey, but portions are huge so it's worth the money.Yum: Quiche Lorraine - light and fluffy with a perfectly thin and buttery crust.Crab Cake Eggs Florentine- good amount of crab, egg cooked perfectly, overall very yummy.Hashbrowns- crispy and brown on the outside, soft and potato-ey inside...perfect!Bread- exactly how french bread should be.Bloody Mary Bar! Build your own with as many olives/pickled veggies as you want! FYI: All vodka is the same price and they have 4 or 5 options.Meh: Croque Madame with an over-easy egg-- more over than easy. But the bread was TO DIE FOR!We also had a great view of the Bellagio from the patio.  The wait can take a while, but it's worth it. Can't wait to come back!"
862,"This is my FAVORITE restaurant in Vegas thus far!Best seats would be indoors, but just right beside the outdoor seating where you get a window view of the strip.  The seating inside gets a little tight, but the food definitely compensates for it.Reserve a table, or else you will be the one  watching others with reservations just strolling across you and sitting at the table that you've been waiting for. Where to begin with the delicious food...Get the mussels! They are plump and fluffy, best that I've ever had.  However, I think they were better in the summer, as I have gone back during the winter and they have shrunk significantly in size.  Not the season?Escargot... mmmmm.. garlicky, buttery goodness.Seared scallops were also superb.  We haven't tried any of the meat plates because my bf and I are so hung up on the seafood that we always just end up getting that.Oh yeah, we did try the frisee and warm bacon salad.  How good can a salad get, really?  It's GOOOOD. and very appetizing."
863,"This place is to die for.  I went there a couple of weeks ago, and I have been wanting to go back ever since.  Staff was extremely attentive, and I love the atmosphere of the place.Both my wife and I loved our food, and it was reasonably priced.  We got an appetizer and two meals, and including the tip it was around $80.    I promise that if you go here you will not regret it."
864,"My favorite restaurant in Vegas, thus far. My friend and I went to brunch here on our first morning in Vegas (of this trip) and got seated at a table right away (whew!) despite how busy they were. We got a nice spot right inside the window seating which has a great view of the Bellagio and strip surrounding. They had an eggs benedict special with tomato and spinach that was sooo good. My friend, who introduced me to Mon Ami Gabi from her last trip, repeatedly goes back for the croissant breakfast sandwich. Service was great, food was great, view was great...what's not to love so far?My friend gets a little too drunk this night...hey, it's Vegas...and is out of commission for the rest of the following day. I woke-up craving the previous morning's meal and decide to go back on my own. I sat at the bar where Robert was bartending. He was very comical with the wait staff and made the whole experience entertaining, while providing the best service of course! He was very attentive, accommodating & friendly. The meal was excellent as it was the day before, but the service was even better. :) My no longer hungover friend came with me to sit at the bar on day three of our trip. Robert was working again, and gave us continual good service. My friend and I tried new entrees at his recommendation that were just as delicious as our favorites. The assistant GM, Clancy, was also extremely professional and offered above and beyond good service. He gave us his special (very tasty!) english muffins for being return customers all trip and even offered me a wisp when I complained of having food in my teeth---how awesome is that!I highly recommend Mon Ami Gambi for the deeeelicious brunch, above and beyond service, great location, and so much more!! I will definitely go back whenever I return to Vegas."
865,"Well what can I say, this place is delicious for brunch. Out door seating is a must!!! You get a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains. I ate here for brunch for mothers day, it was my first time and I had a nice time. A bit pricy but well worth it, I will defiantly go again."
866,"Loved this place! We booked in the morning through yelp and got a table in the cafe overlooking the strip and fountains. Awesome! Our waitress was so nice and helpful, advised me really well on dietary requirements, and the food was delicious. I can't get over the price for the quality. Really good value, you would expect to pay so much more elsewhere. Mmm would go back every night but you'd have to roll me on the plane. I had filet mignon with fries and red wine sauce and my date had the big flat steak (oops memory fail) with peppercorn sauce and fries."
867,"I've eaten there four times over the last few years, and so far it's definitely my favorite place to eat in Vegas.  Even though they offer several sauce choices for their steaks, the meat is so flavorful I don't want to spoil it with the bearnaise or roquefort.  Instead, I save that for the pom frites (fries), which is divine.  The appetizers and french bread are great too."
868,"I LOVEDDDD Mon Ami Gabi! We went here for brunch and were able to sit outside and watch the fountains across the way at the Bellagio. I had a crab cake as an appetizer that was a little slice of heaven. The rest of our food was good as well. If your going to go here I would stay away from the ordinary club type sandwiches (turkey, cheese, bacon) they are just regular sandwiches. Go out of your box and try something different. That's what my friend and I did and we were impressed with our food. (She had a crab sandwich and I had a french crepe. Our hubbys ordered the reg. sandwiches which were nothing special)  I would definately love to go back to try the dinner menu and I'm so glad they have a Mon Ami Gabi over here in Chicago for me to go try."
869,"Pros: this restaurant literally feels like it's from France, with the old dripping paint on the wall. The service here is excellent. They checked up on us every now and then and refilled my drink every so often. Cons: For the amount you pay, the food was decent. I got a seafood crepe, with basically 3 prawns and 2 scallops and a crepe. It was decent, i barely touched my meal. My friends got a quiche and a steak. They said it was decent as well. Your call.Overall: It's not a bad place to try if you're up at least $80 :)  lucky for all of us, vegas provides us with that opportunity to gamble huh and win some money! (half-kidding)"
870,"Want to give a shout out to My T. on this one, because him and his wife Thao T. brought me here for the first time.  But Alcatraz is for locals too, so don't hate plaYa!!One of my favorite brunch spots on the strip.  Actually I've been in Vegas for a little less than a month now, so I don't have too many brunch spots on the strip, but I still love this place.Nice tip:  Also learned this from My T, when you're waiting for your table, there is a bar in the back in the outside area where you can hang out and people watch and enjoy a drink.  This is actually a crucial part of the experience here for me.  Tip #2, you want a table outside.  Inside is a bit boring and I always see the younger crowds outside.Good food (a bit pricey, but that's how the strip rolls) good people watching and other views like the fountains, this place is cool.  I still would give it 5 stars even though I feel the food is a bit pricey.Recommendations on food are the salmon salad if you are gonna be a weenie and not want something greasy like me sometimes, or I would go steak frites if you wanna go big.  The fries are crispy which is too annoying.I have yet to try the onion soup, everyone seems to be raving about it!"
871,"I have had two excellent experiences here and will always keep this on the list for Vegas trips.  Amazing breakfast with bachelor party buddies with just enough pomp and circumstance for a celebratory weekend.  Then, I had lunch on my last trip and really liked the French simple options for a moderate price.  In addition, they have wonderful house wines bottled for them in France.  Highly recommend as long as that does not make the line longer for me."
872,"My 24 hours in Vegas ended with getting some breakfast here to take on the road. Calling in to make an order was a little confusing in the beginning. We called the first time to see if we can phone in an order and the lady said yes. The second time we called to actually give them an order another lady said we would have to come in and order at the bar. Then the third time I asked to be transferred to the bar and finally we were able to make our order. So side note: If you call and want to place an order to go, just ask to be transferred to the bar.  When we got there our order was already waiting for us. Unfortunately it wasn't correct. I ordered the Bananas Foster Waffle but all I got was a plain waffle. I let the bartender, Robert, know and he was on it. He was shocked and embarrassed that the order wasn't correct. His actual words were, ""This ain't Denny's!"" This guy was awesome! He offered us free mimosas while we waited. Who are we to decline free drinks?!The bananas and sauce came out before we were halfway done with our mimosas. So we downed those things and were on our way. I think my waffle would have been quite delicious if it was fresh out of the kitchen. A bad part on me to order something like that to go. I did like how the waffle itself was fluffy too bad the crisp outside wasn't there anymore. However I did love the foster sauce! The brown sugar, butter, vanilla and cinnamon were well balanced. Very subtle sweetness that went well with the bananas.My sister ordered the eggs benedict and while it wasn't the best we had it was still pretty darned tasty. The eggs were cooked perfectly the hollandaise sauce was a little watery to me but still flavorful.Food was pretty good but Robert's friendliness and attempt to please us stood out the most for me. People were eating at the bar too so if you don't want to wait for a table the bar is great. Especially if Robert's the bartender."
873,"5 stars for location - Paris is old-school Vegas and the restaurant has a great ambience.  Can't beat sitting on the patio watching the Bellagio fountains. Service was attentive but kind of ho-hum. We asked if it was possible  for the heater to be turned on, but were given a firm no -  with no explanation. My first two choices on the menu were not available (it was a late reservation, so no blame there) so I had the Skate, which was texturally interesting, and I really enjoyed. The sides were lackluster, and my boyfriend's steak with blue cheese sauce was just average. After the great reviews they had, I guess I expected more than a fairly average meal, but average it was."
874,"Great place for brunch.  My wife had made a reservation and, once again, she nailed it.  We were not disappointed (except for the service, read below).  We started with a carafe of the Frangria, which is awesome.  However, had I spotted it sooner, I would have ordered the self-serve Bloody Mary bar.I started with the house-made pate.  It was delicious but the portion was huge.  I needed about 1/2 the portion but it was so good, I ate all of it.  My wife had the Butter Lettuce salad.For our brunch entrees, my wife had the Ham and Cheese Crepe.  She seemed to like it.  I had the Seafood Crepe.  It was very good but my shrimp were overdone.Overall, this was a delicious brunch.  I like the fact that our table was in the sun room.  I also like the fact that you don't have to walk through the entire casino to get to it.One critique.  I don't know what happened but about midway through our meal, our server started ignoring us and when she did come by, she was very short with us.  It didn't start out that way so I'm not sure if we did something or not.  Hey Roxanne, you are the sole reason this isn't a 5 star review."
875,"How have I not reviewed this already? This is my Las Vegas Staple. The Filet Mignon is solid (I prefer the merlot butter over the creme fraiche). Regardless, this is arguably the best value for your buck. About $30/steak and the steaks are amazing. The service is fantastic and the food is just fabulous. I could eat loaves and loaves of their bread... they sometimes have a special dessert -a  white chocolate bread pudding thing with caramel. If they have it when you're there, GET IT. I don't like white chocolate or bread pudding, but for some reason this was just BOMB. I come here every time I'm in Vegas. One piece of advice: Make a reservation & request outside seating. You can watch the bellagio watershow from your seats on the patio :) Beautiful!"
876,"Cute cafe outside of the Paris Hotel.  Their outdoor seating (on a good day) has always attracted my attention but when I went I had to sit indoors to escape the heat and crazy winds.The interior decor was great and made me feel like I was actually in Paris (err, not sure how authentic it is since i've never been but for the likes of me, it was perfect!)Best Muscles I've ever eaten in life. I will be back for more... entree order this time."
877,"I thought the service was HORRIBLE! It was rude, the wait was long nothing good to say about the service. The food was average. The atmosphere is great though."
878,"Had never been here before Sunday night.  Right across from the Bellagio, you can sit inside or out on the patio and see the water show. I was with the guys, but seemed like a nice place inside for a romantic interlude.. darkly lit, with old world decorations and high ceilings.. believe there was a fireplace as well.. you get the picture.  We had a 40 minute wait for the patio.  Food was xlnt.    For cocktails the waitress recommended a French Martini, sounded good, tasted fantastic, but failed to check on cost and it was $12.95 for one drink!  OK it was super fantastic, (gee I need to make more money).. Shared a baked cheese appetizer, table loved it, I had the scallops with a pureed mushroom sauce, best scallops I had ever eaten. Think they were $23.. Lovely.. would not hesitate to return ..this is a steak house, but no one tried a steak, one guy dieting had soup, another had the fish and chips which was a flat fillet rather than the breaded chunky pieces you usually see.  Everything was excellent, bill was $180 for 3, which included 3 cocktails and 2 glasses of wine and a shared dessert."
879,"I love this place and with so many bad food places in Vegas robbing us of our hard earned money Mon Ami Gabi lifted my spirits.By bf and I decided to sit inside because it was cooler than sitting on the patio and not too busy. We were seated in the the dining area just before the cafe. It was a lovely spot because the sunlight was streaming in and it looked like a beautiful, peaceful atmosphere to have lunch in.Our waiter greeted us and we ordered right away; my bf ordered the Steak Frites and I ordered the Salmon dish. The wait was a bit long but nonetheless we were expecting the best from previous reviews. The dishes arrived and my bf received a beautiful juicy steak (order it medium) with a side of crispy potato ""fries"". Then the waiter grabs a dish of heaping mussels!!!! I thought to myself, ""Am I really going to have to eat this?"" since I'm not usually a person to complain at restaurants and actually considered just eating it. I kindly told the server, not our waiter, that I had ordered the Salmon. He said he would check with the waiter. The waiter came over and apologized claiming the buttons are right next to each other and had accidentally pressed the wrong button. Eek! Expensive mistake.I did wait for my salmon to be cooked and it did feel like it took a long time. I tried my bf's steak and I melted... trying to save my appetite I only had a few more bites but I was hooked. My salmon arrived and it was delicious! It had green peas, snow peas, in a ""green"" sauce. I'm not really sure how to describe it. It was light, refreshing, and the salmon was flakey. After we finished our meals, our waiter came back and offered to order us a dessert on the house. My bf and I shared the creme brulee which we were originally wanting to order but decided not to. Not it was free! It was a little over done as the crust layer was hard like candy, not slightly crusted, but I was just so happy that they acknowledged the mistake and comped us. Everything was wonderful and I will go back.P.S. When I came back home to LA, I gushed to a friend that I went to this place for lunch and she claimed that her mother always eats there when in Vegas because the food is so good. Score!"
880,"Spectacular!  Best seat in Vegas, great service and great food!"
881,We came here for breakfast and were really looking forward to it based on the reviews online. I think we came here at the wrong time. We got seated and it took a while to get drinks and order taken (about 10-15 minutes). We finally got to order our coffee but we received without a creamer. The gentleman mentioned he would be back but he did not return. We asked a bus boy for the creamer cleaning the other table and he brought us a dirty one with fresh jam all over the bottom. We asked our waiter for another creamer. We both decided to order their eggs benedict (I ordered the Florentine and my boyfriend ordered the crab).The Florentine was the worst I have ever had. The eggs were sloppy and the asparagus was small cut up piece. I almost sent it back because I thought the asparagus was missing. I am a big fan of eggs florentine and I was surprised to not see fresh asparagus. The asparagus looked like cut up pieces of artichoke hearts. Our English muffins were overly buttered and took away from the meal. My boyfriend didn't finish his crab benedict. It was salty and the overly buttered muffin didn't help. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing here today. The coffee was the best thing about our meal.
882,"I've been to the one in Chicago several times and it's always fun, good food, and not too expensive! The one in Vegas did not disappoint - I was shocked at how large the restaurant is...when you walk into the bar where the host stand is - looks like a typical Mon Ami Gabi...very quaint...and then you keep walking! It really is amazing."
883,"Mussels French fries apple tart tatin chicken or steak sandwich, escargot, French onion soup, n bread are all good. Avg food is hamburger, seafood crepe (premade not fresh crepe)."
884,"WINNING! That's what Mon Ami Gabi did for my gal pal and I this past weekend. The view and our service were all top notch. The butter merlot filet was excellent...cooked perfectly and was ever so juicy and delicious. The house pinot complimented the filet perfectly (like Charlie Sheen and cocaine). The warm flourless chocolate cake was scrumptious and the perfect way to end our dinner...and start the night. Viva Las Vegas baby, yeah!"
885,"I didn't realize that it is a French STEAKhouse (pretty much), so I was a little bummed because we had reservations at Craftsteak two days later. I got over it pretty quickly because it was delicious!  You can't have too much steak on vacation...I always say. This restaurant has a gluten free menu. Everything was simple and delicious. I would definitely go back because of the food and the gluten free menu and knowledgeable staff. The only issue was that there were too many people jammed into the space. It is in the Paris right on the street across from the Bellagio fountains so it is popular, but at some point restaurants need to just say NO. The place was brimming with people. We were there 10 minutes before our reservation and we still had to wait at the bar for about 1/2 an hour. We were seated in a kind of crappy spot...between the bar and the kitchen.  Then I realized that most of the seats were crappy unless you were outside. Next time we go here, I am going to ask specifically for an outdoor seat or a booth. We had made our reservations a month in advance."
886,"Wait for a table on the patio.  No matter how long it takes because it is totally worth it.  I am not really a big fan of dining on the strip, but if you have to do it, why not do it outside while enjoying a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and the freaks that come out at night in Las Vegas?We had the seafood appetizer (whole lobster, oysters, shrimp, tuna tartare, seaweed salad.)  The only thing on this appetizer that wasn't amazing was the seaweed salad.  Worth the $24.95 a person price tag.  Also had the Steak Roquefort served with these crispy potatoes.  Very flavorful, but you better love Roquefort cheese or this dish is not for you.  Honestly, the food is beside the point at Mon Ami Gabi.  You'll be too busy staring at the fountains and everyone who walks by.  Fortunately, the food is actually very good.  And you can't find a more romantic spot if you try."
887,"I did indoor seating (my girlfriend had major sunburn from the pool). It was delicious. Wonderfully fresh oyster appetizer, so so amuse bouche. It was a wonderful opportunity to try skate for the first time and I must say I am a huge fan! Tried the Roquefort steak with delicious crispy frites. My potato chips were underwhelming with some soggy/burned but still overall delicious as was the artichoke heart puree. The Dover sole was boring but the Grape Passion/love fest/ whatever the name was cocktail more than made up for it!"
888,I love this place! It's a must when in Vegas!
889,"I'm in love with this place! Food is touristy yet wonderful! I love the view of the Bellagio fountains. I went for brunch and had an eggs benedict. Magnifique! My girlfriend had crepes and they were great too! I can't wait to come back for dinner next time I'm in Vegas!P.S. There are TONS of very over-priced ""fancy"" restaurants in Vegas where the food ends up sucking. Mon Ami Gabi is expensive without being absurd and the food is A+. Give this place a try and make a reservation in advance!"
890,Service was decent.  Food was mediocre. View was great!
891,"The last night for Vegas, we decided to eat late, 1030 at this steak frite/ french bistro location.Recommendation, sit outside if the weather is bearable.  The view and people watching is great, plus pending on time, you'll also see the water show at the Bellagio as your sitting across from it.We ordered the french sangria to start off, and it was pretty decent, a little more red wine taste then I would have liked though.Bread, comes out fresh in the wax paper, and a good butter.Appetizer - I ordered the french onion soup, and my friend ordered the special of the night which was an escargot, i know they have one on the menu, but this one was different.  I didnt taste the excargot, because under no circumstance, will i eat it, i just dont like the taste and consistency.  The french onion soup, was the second best i've ever had, a place near me that is now closed, had the best ive ever had, and this easily took second.  It came out and was also a great portion, for me, a bigger guy with a big appetite.  It was fantastic.  My friend said the escargot was good.Main course - I ordered the filet mignon, with merlot butter, and my friend ordered the filet au poivre with creme fraiche, both medium rare.  Both of these steaks were cooked perfectly.  They also tasted delicious.  There was a difference in the sauce, but the steaks were exactly the same, which is good.  We had gone to craftsteak the night before, but the two places are oddly very different from each other.  overall - easily worth going to, easily order the french onion soup."
892,"Mon Ami Gabi has a great patio, you can see the Bellagio fountains across the street and dine under the Eiffel Tower. My husband and I both really enjoyed the filet mingon with merlot butter, it was very delicious and I highly recommend it! Our server, however, was aloof and a bit snooty, which was really the only turnoff for an otherwise delightful meal."
893,"GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Good Grief!  The ABSOLUTE BEST FILET I've ever had (butter & wine reduction).  Scallops were dreamy (the sauce was ridiculously good).  House Pinot Noir: delicious.  Flourless chocolate cake: divine.  The bread was okay, but who cares?  The ABSOLUTE BEST FILET I've ever had.Next time (Oh yes, there will be a next time.) I do want to sit on the patio.  I could see the Bellagio fountain from the table inside, but not well.  It was still pretty."
894,"Went to Mon Ami Gabi for the first time to celebrate our wedding anniversary with friends. We booked the table on opentable.com a few days before with a note about the celebration. They dont care, not even a congratulatory message. Got the table on the patio we requested, the view was awesome. Bellagio is right across from the restaurant so we can even see the fountain while eating. The restaurant got really busy right around 7:45-8pm on a Saturday night. We ordered some frites, soup of the day, sea scallops, pork chop, steelhead (their special that night).  However, there was something wrong with the server. He was not all quite there, twitching, blinking, stuttering, bumping into the backs of our chairs, etc. We received our frites and entrees not long after we placed the order; however, the soup never showed up. We asked the server about it and he was so confused. So we just cancelled the soup as we didn't want to wait.  Food was okay, nothing special. The frites and scallops were so salty even though they were cooked pretty well. The frites also looked and tasted like the scraps left at the bottom of the pan, brown, over fried crumbs.  The excessive amount of salt totally ruined the dishes. Steelhead was tasty, but we realized that it's 28 bucks when we got the check. It's pretty costly compared to most of the entrees on the menu (average $19-$24). Definitely not worth going back again for the food and service. For the view? Maybe. How disappointing!"
895,"Despite having feet bottoms that burned like Hades from all the walking you do in Vegas, I hobbled over to Mon Ami Gabi for a breakfast of oatmeal ($5+/-) and coffee for breakfast.  It was ok...the coffee was good, which I can't say about most places.Oatmeal is oatmeal, but it was served with milk and raisins...but no butter which I thought strange; however, they did bring out a bowl of brown sugar for me to get my high on it I wanted to.The fun of eating here is sitting outside in the a.m. and watching all the Vegas tourists and loonies go by.  Now that was fun!The service--despite my bill which came to like $10--was superb to the point you would have thought I had ordered a really decent meal of filet..ha!  Kudos to the Paris Hotel for their lack of snobbery at breakfast.I would come back here again for sure."
896,"I hosted my friend's bridal shower brunch here and had such an amazing experience!  We had a party of 13, and were seated in the best part of the restaurant (the back room by the patio...tons of sunshine and warm on cold day).  We were also out of the way of heavy traffic.Although the restaurant was packed due to Memorial Day weekend, our server was so amazing.  Yes, they forgot to bring syrup with the waffles and extra berries with the crepes, but the food was outstanding and they responded quickly to our needs.The breakfast menu was large with many different types of options.  They definitely had something for everyone.  I had the crab cake benedict ($16) and my eggs were perfectly poached.  My friends loved both the savory and sweet crepes and everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered. I would definitely recommend making reservations.  We finished up around 12 noon and there was a long line on our way out.  We made our reservation 2 months in advance (due to the large party/holiday weekend), and when I tried to make a small change two weeks before, they were unable to accommodate, but we still had a great time!"
897,"great view if youre on the patio, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. prices are OK at this place, considering its view. we had a sketchy waiter as well, id figure you could find much better staff in Vegas. wont be back for the service thats for sure. food was good, fries sure dont look like the ones in the pics here. mine were brown and in crumbles"
898,"gave this place a shot because of the prime location and the diverse selection of french dishes. i expected this place to be pretty on the surface with no real substance ..... i was instantly proven otherwise.came with a group for lunch on a nice sunny vegas day and started on the complementary baguette which was hot and fresh. we went through a couple of loafs pretty quickly. the bread was tasty and also nice and light giving you the impression that you can have the whole loaf without feeling guilty.we started off with the frangria which was an obvious relative of the sangria. i made the mistake of noting down the recipe in my head and not somewhere more reliable. nonetheless the frangria was top notch. the fruits were vibrant and present in every sip. mix of red wine and grand mariner tasted better that I had thought. for starters we went with the snails and french onion soup. the snails were a bit greasy and had a very grassy aroma and taste. this was my first time having snails to which i equated the consistency to oysters. the soup did not reach its potential as more flavor could have been added and more cheese could have been layered on the exterior.as for the entrées we all order a sandwich of some sort that came with a bed of greens and/or frites. i ordered the chicken and bree sandwich which was mixed with sautéed onions and green apple that made the sandwich even more delicious. served on ciabatta bread the chicken was moist and decently flavored by itself. the combination of sandwich fillings left me wanting more. the only negative criticism I have about this sandwich was the amount of filling was not evenly portion with the amount of bread provided.the ambiance was great...very open, bright, and diverse. as mentioned the location of the restaurant was excellent being right in the center of the strip making it a great spot to sit back and enjoy the view. not only was the ambiance and location great, the service staff were extremely courteous and our waiter went beyond our expectations."
899,"It was me and my boyfriends 2 Year Anniversary, and we wanted to something fun to celebrate. Naturally we went to VEGAS! We wanted to have a nice romantic dinner, I had searched and found Mon Ami. It had great reviews so I went with it. I got reserverations and thank God I did! It was pretty packed. We had shown up 10 minutes late and there was a line, they seated us right away and asked if it was our first time there. They explained all the fancy lingo on the menu and told us what we should try if we were feeling adventurous. The prices are pretty pricey, but hey it's our anniversary. My b/f got the Filet Mingon marinated in Merlot. I got the Herb Chicken. Man OH Man! It was the MOST DELICIOUS MEAL I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE! I was so glad I picked this place. It was 110%  WORTH EVERY EXPENSIVE PENNY!"
900,"4.5 stars.This place is awesome.  We booked a reservation at 8 PM, with the intention of waiting an extra hour to secure outside seating.  I can understand how this may be annoying to those not in the know.  We planned for it so we didn't really mind waiting around.When we finally made it outside, it was perfect.  Absolutely perfect.  Nice warm evening, table for 2 right on the street with a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains.  So romantic!Extremely nice service, although maybe a bit too hands-off for some.  We didn't mind being left alone but we did have to flag our waitress down for the check.  The carrot soup was pretty good and the filet mignon with merlot butter was great.  For dessert, we couldn't decide between the warm berry crumble and the creme brulee so of course we had to order both.  The crumble was massive and very good.  Judging from the bits of creme brulee I was able to wrangle away from the husband when he wasn't looking - yeah, he's a fan - it was just ok.  Fabulous coffee.Plus, after staring at $15 glasses of wine and $25 appetizers in the face all weekend, it was nice to have a great moderately priced meal without sacrificing taste and ambiance."
901,"We booked our 12:30 reservation through yelp an hour or so before. Upon arrival, we were seated within 10 minutes to a nice table in the covered area near the patio. I was relieved since it was really windy and surprising chilly outside. The restaurant was pretty busy, but we received ample attention; the server was really sweet.I love baguette, and a good size was served in the beginning wrapped in a Mon Ami Gabi bag with butter. It came in a Mon Ami Gabi bag; it was cute how you're left to just tear a piece of bread for your enjoyment rather than coming out cut in a basket.Food:Chopped Greens & 7 Vegetables (Lunch Menu): had it without the blue cheese, came tossed & with avocado / The salad had more content than its name gives it credit for. It came with bacon, and personally, I'm not a bacon person, but it was some good bacon. It was thicker than normal breakfast bacon and gave the salad a nice balance since I didn't add chicken or anything.Corned Beef Hash & Poached Eggs (Brunch Menu): Good quality meat, well-poached eggs, yolk was used to mix the meal together / People who enjoy hash and like their eggs poached will love the item.I felt the menu was a bit limited, but still had a great brunch. Food, ambiance, service, and people were all great."
902,"Well first off, walking up and seeing an exorbitant line gave me the idea that the place was some awesome steak house. Boy was I wrong... Came here with the parents and sat down a little bit after our reservation time, no big deal. The server Martan(?) was alright as he recommended a good wine for the table. Anyways, the hot baguette and pickled carrots were an alright starter. Then came the appetizer; the baked cheese (don't ask why the father thought it would be good). The baked cheese tasted more like a bowl of spaghetti o's sauce accompanied by a piece of pesto covered bread, ick.      Then came the entrees; I ordered the steak bordelaise which came with scrapped french fries which were probably the best part of my experience at mon ami gabi. The first couple bites of my steak were alright, as i ordered it medium, expecting it to be as so throughout, boy was I wrong (again). 2 bites through, I started noticing it was nearly impossible to cut through the steak, much less chew it, without feeling like it was about to fly away off the plate at 100 miles per hour. What I was left with was a mangled piece of tendon, and 2 half chewed rubbery pieces of meat that I couldnt muster up the courage to swallow. Bottom line, this place charges above average prices for below average food, but if you like good bread and french fries, come here I guess. You wont see me here again... for 60 bucks a head I'll wait to head to L'entrecote when I'm in London next."
903,Nice atmosphere.Great serviceInteresting onion soup and scallops (wasn't sure they were done enough). They have duck once a week. which I would have tried but wrong day.  Steak that others have raved about and I found quite okay. Food grade of B.
904,"Ever had that night in Vegas where maybe you had a bit much to drink? Maybe you beat up your friend the stomach with too many cocktails and need to help him feel alive again? Look no further Mon Ami Gabi is the place for a great morning start  recharge for Vegas.  Located at the nice patio of the Paris hotel you can chill out have a mimosa or bloody mary while watching all the finest of street goers, from the good looking to the tickle me elmo's (not kidding) you will see something worth talking about.  Let's get back to the food.... The Corn Beef and Hash! Have it and send me a message thanking me.  Poached eggs with some great toast and spread and you are going to be getting your stomach ready for more. They have several great items for lunch as well, I would strongly recommend some of their seafood it is pretty epic."
905,"Loved the place, went here twice during my four day stay in Vegas: once for breakfast and the other time for lunch. I highly recommend going there for breakfast- great place, great service, and food is pretty good."
906,"Eating in Las Vegas isn't cheap and any place that serves an entree in the realm of $25 can be considered a bargain. We decided to come here for a pre-show dinner. We hadn't eaten anything French recently and being from a backwoods town in the South where French isn't something you see very often, we were ready to try this place. We got reservations and had to only wait about 10 minutes for our table. We got an authentic French waiter but the poor thing was confused for most of the night. I am sure our Southern accents scared the hell out of him. He couldn't remember the specials but that was ok since he seemed like a pretty nice guy.We were starving since we had skipped lunch that day. I ordered the Onion Soup which was very good. They give you a fairly large portion which could be easily split between two people or eaten as a meal in itself with a salad. Our table also ordered the Baked Cheese as appetizer which was delicious. I ended up getting the Steak Bearnaise with hand-cut fries. Not a big fan of the fries. They were cooked properly but I like my potatoes cut thicker. The steak was cooked perfectly and tender. The Bearnaise sauce was very good and probably the highlight of the entree. We passed on dessert. Service was good but not exceptional. The food was good but nothing was spectacular enough to warrant a 5 star consideration. This place is probably more of a 3.5 stars but I will round up due to the appetizer and nice atmosphere. I will be moving to the DC area soon so I may have to hit up the one in Bethesda. For the price you can't beat it though."
907,"Went to Vegas for a bachelorette weekend and first restaurant we stopped into is Mon Ami Gabi.  We didn't have to wait at all since we didn't request for outdoor seating but to our surprise, where we were seated was just as good.  We were just in between the outdoor/indoor seating so it was perfect.  The food and service here is top-notch.  And for brunch, I would consider the price relatively cheap.  My table ordered:chocolate-bacon waffles - YUM! the sweetness of the chocolate complements the saltiness of the bacon very well2x fruit pancakes - these bad boys were ginormous and I would consider them more as crepes than pancakescorned beef hash w/ potatoes - best dish of all the things we ordered.  everyone was taking a bite of this plate because it was so irresistible.I can't wait to check out the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant in Chicago now.  Woohoo!"
908,"We reserved on Open Table, so we only waited about 5 minutes.  I overheard other people saying that the wait without a reservation was about an hour and a half.  So definitely call ahead.  We sat inside and enjoyed the table and the ambiance.My boyfriend is a vegetarian, and has a big appetite.  He ordered the vegetable platter, which was great, but not super big.  He also ordered the macaroni and cheese (au gratin) to supplement and it was really fantastic.  It comes out all baked and yummy with lots of cheese on top.  I ordered the French Onion soup, and it was probably the best I have ever had in my life.  So much cheese, and the broth was really rich.  Bonus: it comes out in a huge dish that looks like a hot tub, so it was very, very filling.Overall, we really enjoyed.  The bill for two, without alcohol, was 51 dollars.  The only downside was that the only real vegetarian option was the vegetable platter, and that it was pretty small.  But what what can I expect from a French steakhouse?"
909,"Ate here for breakfast. The food was absolutely amazing. The waitress was nice, and the atmosphere was also good. Will definitely come here again!"
910,"We came here for dinner on a sat night.  7girls. Our reservations were @ 845pm but they were running 15mins bhind.  We were on a time limit due to the fact we had to be at another place at a certain time.  The manager was really accomodating and let us put in our order so by the time we sat down to our table our food would be out right away.I ordered the grilled chicken (portion was huge, so i shared it) and the scallops.  I highly recommend the scallops!!! They just melted in my mouth.  Though the serving is quite small, its worth it.  Waiter was prompt and knew we had to leave.  It was one of the best 20min dinner i've ever had! hahahathanks for the awesome service!"
911,Had reservations for our anniversary 06-04-2011 @ 7:00 and had to wait for a outside patio table as they do not take reservations. Two girls taking the patio reservations extremely rude and unaccomodating when my wife was seated first while I was paying the bar tab; could not be bothered to tell me where they had seated her and I should just go find her. Service started badly with bread and amouse bouche just plunked down on the table with not explanation. Fortunately management came to the rescue with an apology and champagne. Service from there was great and so was the food. As a local there are many places to dine and the initial experience sets the stage.
912,"After walking the strip for quite some time in the mid-morning hours, I was damn hungry. Mon Ami Gabi looked pretty cute - all French and proper - but they didn't seem to mind when hubs and I rolled up in our workout gear hoping to get a table and some breakfast. The patio was a considerable wait, so we elected sit indoors (which ended up being only 2 feet from the open doors/patio. Hey - we could still see some street performers and a few walks of shame. Fine by me.The service was most excellent and efficient to boot. I went with the lemon pancakes - a giant, but very thin, lemony crepe like pancake with strawberries and a hefty side of fresh whipped cream. Hell. Yeah. The pancake was delicious yet light and the strawberries were uber fresh. I also nabbed a few bites of hubs' quiche lorraine - also a delightful, rich and tasty choice. The one food item I wasn't crazy about was the chicken sausage. Normally I'd down that in 30 seconds flat, but these particular links had an odd spice combo to them...paprika? I don't know, but I didn't dig it. Price wise, Mon Ami Gabi is quite fair - especially for the high quality and portions. Next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely head back here for breakfast!"
913,"I am pretty sure, every time I've ever visited Vegas (which is a lot), I've made it a point to visit Mon Ami Gabi.  It is fabulous!! The experience is started with the warmest, freshest french bread you'll find this side of globe.  It's served with a yummy salad of carrots and pads of melty butter.Any dish you order will be delish, and the alcoholic beverages you choose will knock your socks off.  I've only had one bad experience there - my husband got food poisoning from a raw steak (he asked for it ""still mooing"").  I warned him it looked too raw, but he ate it anyways.  So, the restaurant can't lose points ;-)The frites are excellent, green beans tasty, and any steak on the menu is fabulous.  I haven't tried a dessert there yet, but plan to soon.  Going back for our first wedding anniversary, the perfect place for a romantic dinner... Also, if it's a warm evening, ask for a table outside - you'll get a fabulous view of the Bellagio water show!"
914,"really good steaks. just the right thickness (easy to eat) and very flavorful. not  thick, like the morton's steak kind but just as good. hand cut fries that come with the steak is pretty good too. get the whipped cauliflower with the steak. really creamy and good. nice view of the strip with the bellagio water show right in front of you. can't beat it."
915,"All you need to order is the French Onion soup and the Filet Mignon.  Period.  This was my favorite place we ate at on my trip and we even went back.  We sat on the patio and you can watch the water show at the Bellagio from there.  The filet was so tender you could cut it with a fork and it will melt in your mouth.  They cover with some sort of wine/butter sauce which then gets soaked up by the potatoes.  SCORE!  The French Onion soup is the best I've had.  And I know my FO soup.  If you are in Vegas this is a MUST TRY!  I also had the Pepper Crusted Seared Ahi Tuna Salad with was pretty good, but the filet is the main attraction!"
916,"Just finished my first meal at Mon Ami Gabi. I liked it. I would go back. The seared salmon over peas was great. The service was attentive, and the atmosphere was great -- very lively and varied. I could see the Belagio and its fountains erupting across the street. Lots of fun."
917,"I ordered the steak au poivre, it was delicious, the steak was a large thin piece of meat with a black pepper sauce.  I didn't really know what to expect as for the cut, but it was tasty.  I'd order it again.  I went with a large group of friends, we were a bit late for our 630 pm reservation but were still accommodated, but it was disappointing that we didnt get to sit outside.  I split a bottle of champagne with some friends which was fun.  The bread was delicious here and I loved the french cafe atmosphere.We had good service from the waitress, but she did make a few faces since a few at the table were a bit on the drunk side.  I'd come here again."
918,If you want to eat at something other than the Bellagio or Wynn buffet in Vegas you have to try Mon Ami Gabi. Its moderately priced and the food is fucking delicious. I had the Hanger Steak and it was amazing.You should make a reservation for outside sometime after sunset. On the patio you have a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.
919,"The brunch food is just plain ol' good french food I'll find anywhere on the streets of Orange County. I'm so glad I chose to eat here instead of an infamous buffet; same cost but less evil on the body. The wait to sit outside is about 5 times that of sitting indoors (actually, we didn't have to wait at all for a table inside), but the atmosphere is calm and soothing; the food, I'm sure, is just as great.The whipped cream from the blueberry pancakes is to die for. I dipped everything in there at least once, even my eggs benedict. If you're with a group of girls and don't feel like binging, start the day out here and you won't regret!"
920,"Located at the Paris hotel in Viva Las Vegas, this is by far the best French restaurant on the strip. For appetizers we ordered baked cheese and it did not disappoint. The filet mignon is cooked in a red wine reduction. I now understand what a tender and flavorful filet is supposed to taste like. A friend ordered the skirt steak and said it was also very good. The house red merlot was also very impressive.For dessert, we shared the bread pudding. Again another home run!To get the full experience, ask to be seated outside and enjoy the view of the bellagio fountains (on a weekend expect a long wait for outdoor.Went back with on girls trip and it did not disappoint!"
921,"I was eagerly looking forward to eating at a French restaurant to celebrate my birthday with my girls in Vegas. Our reservation was for Saturday at 8:45pm. It was a little hectic because we needed to be someplace in an hour and we were told our table wouldn't be ready for another 15 minutes. We asked if we could put in our food orders while we waited for our table and the hostess and manager were very accommodating. I wanted to eat light, so I ordered the Scallops Gratinee and the French Onion soup. The scallops were absolutely scrumptious: three little shell- shaped tins filled with roasted garlic and creamed spinach, topped with a sea scallop that melted in my mouth. I gobbled this up so quickly. Then I moved on to the French Onion soup, which was warm and full of ooey-gooey cheese that made my tummy and my tastebuds smile.I REALLY wanted to sit in the patio to watch the fountains, but there was a two hour wait. Apparently it's first come, first serve for those tables and you can't reserve them. Oh well, that would have made my birthday perfect, but at least they got us in and out so we could get to Marquee on time! Can't wait to go back with the hubby!"
922,Nice French food with a great view if the Bellagio fountains
923,"It's refreshing to get such quality for a reasonable price on the Las Vegas strip. Mon Ami Gabi is a French bistro with a long list of meals that is sure to please. Their steaks are most popular, but it's the fish that steals the show. The flavours are complexe, the food is fresh and the view can't be beat. I had the seared salmon and my husband had the skate. Both were cooked to perfection and served with a healthy portion of sides. They offer a wide selection of wines by the glass and while the restaurant is busy and noisy (much like the rest of Las Vegas Blvd) it is easy to get swept away into a great meal. Keep in mind that even if you make a reservation and ask to be seated on the balcony, they will not always honour it."
924,"Outdoor seating is great for people watching and seeing the Bellagio Fountains.  Mon Ami Gabi was a family affair before seeing our show at the Rio.  It was a great reminder of my recent trip to Paris.  Some of the food was just fantastic, but others lacked flavor.  As a party of five, we started off with a carafe of ""Frangria,"" which was fantastic!  Then had three different appetizers to share:  Warm Brie Cheese, Warm Duck Confit Salad, and the Mussels Mariniere. Two Onion Soups au Gratin.  Then for our individual entrees we ordered:  Frisee & Warm Bacon Salad, Steak Classique, Bone-in Ribeye, Sea Scallops, ""Poisson du Jour"" = Sea Bass w/ Roasted Corn Couscous.  Being so full, we still had room for dessert...(drum roll please)... Bananas Foster Crepe.  In summary, here's what I would definitely get again and what items I would pass up.  Five Stars:  Frangria, Mussels Mariniere (so memorable!), Warm Brie Cheese--was finished off, but I personally didn't have any because I'm not a cheese person, Frisee & Warm Bacon Salad (yummy poached egg!), Bone-in Ribeye (perfectly cooked and juicy), Sea Scallops, Bananas Fosters CrepeFaaaaahget about it:  Warm Duck Confit Salad (supbar duck confit to the ones served in Paris--lacked salt/flavor), Onion Soup (not impressive--didn't have a depth of flavor was was too sweet, plus the cheese wasn't gooey), Steak Classique (ehhh....least the fries were good)"
925,"If it was just for the French Toast, 5 stars. I'm not including Creme Brulee French Toast, or Brioche French Toast.  That stuff is awesome, but I'd put that in another category.  Gabi just has the best straight up French Toast I've ever had.  The inside is nice and eggy, but still relatively light and fluffy, so it's not waterlogged.The whipped cream is delicious, although, if you're concerned about overdoing it, I'd ask for a lighter serving.The other dishes are really good, and are worth coming back for, but don't stand out quite as much as the french toast.Didn't like the coffee."
926,"Went here awhile ago and I miss this place.  It's the best place I've eaten by far in Vegas.  I wanted  to go to a french restaurant that doesn't charge so much $$$$.  Looked up in yelp and decided to come here. We ordered:French onion soup - I had better soup somewhere else but this was also really good! Rib eye steak with fries - fries was nothing to rave about, but the steak was the best I've ever had and the sauces on the side was just amazing. I usually don't like to use sauce with my steak but wow it was so good. The best Rib eye steak. I love Rib eye steak.  I normally eat my steak with horse radish yummy.Banana crepe Foster? - OMFG really? I can not believe how good this crepes were. I'm not that into crepes.  I haven't had crepes at many places, but I believe this is the best crepe ever! The sauce was to die for. We wanted to lick the plate lol =p......I wish we went here the pass few times while  in Vegas =(The service was good. The lady was pleasant. Everything was great! Love this place.I want to go back! This is one of the best meal I've ever had anywhere that I've been to. Why does it have to be so far away."
927,"We went over Memorial Day weekend for my friend's birthday. I made reservations the day before for 8 people, but we had another person join us. They accommodated us, which was nice since we told them when we checked in.We waited about five minutes to be seated, then were taken to a booth in the middle of the restaurant. I ordered the New York strip with the french fries and a bowl of their soup of the day, Creme of Asparagus. The soup was really good, especially when I dipped the baguette bread in it. But my favorite part of the entire meal was the french fries! I love crunchy french fries and all of them were! The steak was good too, but I didn't finish it because I had finished all of the fries.Our waiter was very attentive. Service is a little slower here, but it's meant to be...it is a sit down restaurant after all. If you're in a hurry somewhere, then this is not the place to go. Enjoy the food and the company that you're with."
928,"I'm a huge fan of Mon Ami Gabi - great food, great view, excellent prices.  Delicious doesn't have to break the bank.  The french onion soup is excellent, as is the escargot.  I always get the steak frites - thin cut of steak, cooked to perfection (often, you find the thinner cuts of steak come out well done, but not here; medium rare, as requested).  You won't be disappointed with a meal here, give it a shot."
929,"3.5 starsOh God.  As I mentioned in my last review, we came back here for my friend's bachelorette.  I made the reservation a week in advance.  When I got there, I had to change it because a girl dropped out. If you use Yelp to get phone numbers, this one is incorrect.  It takes you to Effiel Tower Restaurant.  I did eventually get through and told her I needed to ""change tomorrow's reservation."" (The reason I changed it for one person is because if your entire party isn't seated, you can't be considered for deck seating.) She told me she couldn't find me anywhere and I was put on hold for a long time, several times.  Finally she said ""I found your reservation under tomorrow.  There must have been an error."" Me: ""Nope. I wanted it for tomorrow."" Gah.  So that was figured out.Then the day of, the girls are running late and ask me to push it back.  I tell the hostess, ""can you push the reservation for Ninette for 11 back 30 minutes?"" She said, ""ok Clark (or something equally ridiculous) for 5!"" What now? Eh, maybe it was loud.We did make it there and were seated inside (outside was a 2 hour wait).  My friend and I ordered the escargot for appetizer to share and the seafood platter for our entree.  The seafood platter came with 4 oysters, shrimp cocktail, tuna cervice, seaweed salad, several sauces and an entire lobster.  I also just checked and there were supposed to be crackers. Huh. Never saw that. Either way, it looked pretty impressive, not going to lie.  The escargot were good.  They came in a pesto-ish sauce.  The seafood platter was all good except for the main event: the lobster.  The lobster was chewy and overcooked.  We thought we would need steak knives.  I don't know what kind of lobster it was called but it had the spongy legs/claws that I didn't really like either.I still think this place is pretty reasonably priced and a good balance between casual and fancy for Vegas.  The bad lobster and confusion put me off a bit more than the first time, but for mostly-good food and prices, I'll keep my 3.5 stars under 4."
930,"Dang. This place was tres delicious. We got the cool and refreshing vichyssoise soup, the warm chicken and brie sandwich and the open-faced BLT plus the hand-cut potato chips and artichoke dipping sauce. So good. Sit on the patio for perfect views of the Bellagio fountains and a high quality, leisurely meal. Upscale, but not pretentious. Prices were comparable to a $$ restaurant in LA, but the quality and freshness of the meal was superb. We wanted to come back, but decided that in our short stay, we should try a few other restaurants - few could compare with Mon Ami Gabi, however. Definitely making a stop next time we're in town."
931,"For someone half a dozen drinks in while wandering the Strip on the Sunday before his departure from this playground of a city, Mon Ami Gabi was a complete and pleasant surprise!  I couldn't believe that in such a touristy spot I would stumble upon a restaurant devoted so earnestly to quality cuisine.Our appetizers consisted of vegetable crudites and hand-cut potato chips.  Simple yet delicious, the waffle-cut chips were thin and crispy.I tasted the bacon brie cheeseburger, the tuna nicoise and the vichyssoise, and I'd recommend all of them.  The tuna tartine was topped with some of the best seared ahi I've eaten, seasoned with something heavenly.  The brie burger was so decadent, so juicy and flavorful, that I completely forgot that I was eating in the bulls eye of the tourist capital of the country.  Even without the brie the burger was cooked perfectly and made of some of the best ground beef I've tasted.  The vichyssoise was standard, but it tasted fantastic on a hot June afternoon.The rest of the menu looks heavenly.  I'm sure the next time I'm in Sin City I'll make my way there.  Bon appetit!"
932,"BOTTOM LINE: There are enough good things about Mon Ami Gabi to deserve a four star review based on our dinner there last week. With so many restaurants in Las Vegas on the Strip, this is not one we'd necessarily seek out again unless it was a matter of convenience and timing that led us there.  But the outdoor patio seating provides a great opportunity for people watching and seeing the Bellagio fountain both, the food is good and the prices reasonable by Las Vegas standards.  So we're glad we went and can easily recommend it.SEATING: We were a group of ten and we wanted an outdoor table so some of the folks involved  who had not been to Las Vegas before could watch the Bellagio fountains, right across the street, as they had dinner. Reservations are not taken for outdoor seating, and it was impressive that they could cobble together a table for ten with only about a 30 minute wait at 6:30. But what we learned from this is that Mon Ami Gabi's outdoor patio seating is probably best for couples or groups up to six just for the logistics of putting tables together. SERVICE: The restaurant was hopping inside and out and yet service was efficient for taking the orders and getting the food to the right diners and served at the right temperature. Not particularly friendly, but efficient worked in this case. FOOD: For a Las Vegas restaurant the range of choices, all with a French bistro bent, was impressive and the prices seemed more reasonable than other comparable places on the Strip. As example, a duck confit small plate that included a good dried cherry garnish was only about $11 and plenty for an entree for a light eater. Same with the crab cake served with a small slaw type salad for about $15. Same for the Caesar salad that was about $10. Steaks (served with pommes frites) for roughly $25.00 each. Scallop entree was about $30. And so on. Meals included some really good, crusty baguette set in the middle of the table in paper bags at the start. VALUE:  Total bill for ten, excluding cocktails but including a couple of beers, a couple of coffees and a soft drink,  was about $230.  A bargain by Strip standards. LIBATIONS: While we waited on our table, some of us adjourned to the (tiny) indoor bar for a cocktail. My hubby said his Maker's mint julep was very good and my Sidecar was one of the best I've had. Cousins in law had good things to say about their rum and cokes and whiskey and sodas. Cousin in law who picked up the tab said they were spendy. As I recall, five cocktails topped $60. AMBIANCE: The outdoor patio can be fun, for the reasons named in the start of this review. The indoor portion of the restaurant is actually quite large and seating in some of it offers a white tablecloth, cozy bistro ambiance. But, the indoor seating adjacent to the outdoor bar is NOT the best in the place...not the charm of inside and not the view perspective of outside and with a lot of traffic through it from wait staff and diners. So we'd recommend avoiding this section of the restaurant.RESERVATION NOTE:  If you make a reservation (indoor seating only) you will need to provide a credit card.  Two hour in advance cancellation is required or your credit card will be charged $50 per head of the reservation. (Example, for a reservation for six people the default charge is $300.)  This isn't the only restaurant in Las Vegas to employ a similar tactic (Mesa as example does something similar).  But may be helpful to know this in advance."
933,"I decided to make a Yelp Account just so I could write this review. I've been a long time reader and often used others suggestions and reviews to pick a destination restaurant. Yelp found us Mon Ami Gabi. The scenario: It was my mom's birthday. So we decided to celebrate in Vegas. Saw a show, gambled, hung out by the pool... the usual eat, drink be merry, etc! But for the birthday night dinner, the objective was not over the top expensive but still really good food/ambiance/service/overall experience was a must. And we found it here, in Paris (Vegas of course). The food: delicious! Oh and the wine was paired perfectly! Started with cheese and fruit (yum!) and warm olives (good and simple). Loved the bread too and the chardonnay carrots side! Main course: I had the fillet (with the recommended rouqefort), it was amazing! and my mom had the special fish of the day: chilean seabass with a corn that is beyond the concept of corn (so good).  And of course a little french pastry puff to finish for the birthday dessert. The ambiance: umm did we accidentally leave Vegas and wind up in Paris? :)The service: Martin ... fabulously french, attentive, informative. The overall experience: 5 stars for sure. We loved it!! Side note: A lot of people recommended sitting outside (to see the fountains) but honestly we realized while it would have been great for bellagio fountain and people watching it is much more of a dining experience inside. Stand outside, watch the show before you go in. Then once inside let yourself be whisked away into a French feast fantasy. It will be si magnifique!"
934,Came here for Lunch. Had a reservation. We were seated at the Patio. Water waiter was very friendly. Our waitress was n t really friendly. Bread was good. We both had the brie. Was Cold and Not so good. Both had Steaks with redwine. We ordered Medium. Was med rare. Fries were ok. Nothing Special. Spinach to garlic flawored. Don't Kiss anybody after this. View was amaizing. Service Not good. We got spinach 5 min before the Steaks. I think its to expensive.
935,"Thanks to Yelpers for helping three generations of Foodies find our way here for Sunday Brunch. Great food, OK (yet friendly) service, lively atmosphere. Rather than wait 20-30 minutes for a patio table, we opted for immediate indoor seating - it landed us ""just"" inside but practically outside. It's a pretty, ""french-y"" decor with nicely presented and tasty fare: mushroom/brie omelet, asparagus/ham quiche, strawberry w/whipped cream topped waffles; wonderful strong coffee and fresh-squeezed OJ.A good value for good food."
936,"We went there for dinner after our wedding.  We had 15 people in our party and got served with no problems and our server was great! My mother and I started with the mussels as an app and they were HUGE, and weren't gritty at all.  Prices aren't too bad, especially for the quality of food and service.  So glad we picked this place.  Next time I want to go earlier during the day so i can try the crepes."
937,"Pricey, but nice. Delicious. =) I think their buffet in the hotel has a great selection. The last time we ate there it was their breakfast buffet which we used the 7 buffet passes with. Everyone liked it. No complaints. And everyone seemed to have enjoyed their dinner here as well..."
938,"Wish I could say, it was packed because of the quality of the food.Restaurant is right on the strip, in front of Paris, and facing the bellagio fountains. It's all about location, location, location! Our party of four came on a saturday night for dinner. Of course it was a full house. We were told it would be an hour wait for inside & an hour and a half for outside. Since it was getting late we opted for whatever was fastest. Thankfully we only waited roughly 45 mins & we were even seated outside :) YAY lucky us!Tables and seating arrangements were really narrow. Complimentary bread was pretty yummy - your typical french bread. Except they gave butter and this interesting shredded carrot spread. Oddly enough, it was actually quite good with the bread. LOL!I ordered the steak classique with maitre d hotel butter. ($23.95), which is a large thin cut of steak with an herb butter sauce. It was good but nothing outstanding. The meat was a large piece, but thin so when asked for medium, it was more medium well to well done. The fries that accompanied it were overfried & overly crispy.  The rest of my party wasn't too impressed as well. They got the filet mignon, steak bordelaise, and scallops. Our table rated the scallops as the best thing that night.Ambiance was nice, romantic, but over crowded so it kinda killed the romance. Service was just okay. Kinda had to ask for refills on bread & soft drinks. They were good about refilling water though. Best thing about the place is sitting outside on the patio watching the bellagio show while eating. Would I go back? Surprising to say but probably not. I could have ate better quality & more at a buffet for the price."
939,"I consider this a touristy place that is French food for Americans. A real french restaurant would serve duck. I would compare it to a Cheesecake Factory where you receive a buzzer when your table is ready except that you get warm french bread served at your table. I wouldn't go back here again. If you want a more intimate experience, go to Joel Rubichon or Guy Savoy where you'll get better quality food."
940,"Mon Ami Gabi made me reminisce about all the fabulous times i had in Paris. The layout of restaurant is almost exactly like the bistros in France. Our table had the best view of the Bellagio water show and on a warm summer day.. ah.. it was so chic (=It was a really busy night and thank god i made reservations on yelp earlier in the day! Even though there was so much people, our waiter was still very accommodating. This is what we had for our dinner:Grilled pork tenderloin - The pork was so tender! (= and the sauce that came with it was divine. The caramelized onion sauce had the sweet aroma of onion with a little touch of wine. The tomato-bacon farci that came with it was light and crisp, which paired perfectly with the pork.Filet Mignon- Oh my god! this must of been one of the most tenderest steaks i have ever eaten in my life! It was cooked perfectly medium-rare just like how the French do it. The Filet mignon basically melted like butter on my tongue. (="
941,"First meal (Saturday brunch) of the Memorial Day weekend trip.  Best meal of the weekend (which we didn't know then), and it was great to sit outside, drink ""Frangria"" and watch the fountains.  Doesn't get much better than this.Baguette and butter to start, and then we went with the cheese plate and pate (again) and the eggs benedict off the brunch menu.  Great service, great food and drink, reasonable prices at lunch."
942,"My meal at Mon Ami Gabi can be summed up in one word : TENDER.Tender is a strange word on its own, but when combined with other words like filet and mignon it is perfection.A group of 6 of us arrived to the Mon Ami Gabi restaurant on a Friday night (with a reservation, which I highly recommend), and waited about 15 minutes to get a table.  They have a huge outdoor seating area, but we requested to sit indoors because it was in the triple digits outside.  We were sat in the area adjacent to the patio, which ironically was really chilly and a number of people around us felt the same way.  Beware the breezy area betwixt the outside HEAT and the a/c CHILL from inside.Anyhow, the food was AMAZING.  HIghlights were the fromage appetizer with a blend of yummy cheeses, and the amazement that was the Filet Mignon with Merlot butter sauce.  If you get the server known as 'Georgie,' you'll be in for a treat.  She was absolutely lovely, and took the time to explain many things to us, from drinks to entrees.  She was awesome.Overall, an awesome experience.. and I'll say it again.. the Filet Mignon was perfect, juicy and tender.  And I do love me tender.."
943,"Lovely - facing the Bellagio fountains, outdoor patio, full on french interior, good service, good food? Sooo glad we ate there instead of having Buffet of buffets. Food: A-Ambience: AService: AValue: B"
944,"This place is AMAZING. Everyone in my group was so happy we found this place. Their breakfast is just amazing. I wanted to stay in vegas permanently just to eat here every day.  The croissants and raspberry jam are perfect together. They have some of the best coffee I've ever tasted. EVERYTHING for breakfast is pretty much great. The waitstaff are friendly. For dinner: the steaks are well worth the money. I wouldn't pay $35-45/per person every night for dinner, but it is worth going at least once for dinner. Love this place. Make sure you make reservations, especially for dinner."
945,"We discovered this place when they first opened and NO ONE was really dining here. Now you're lucky to get seated within an hour if you come without a reservation.The food is marvelous and you get good value for your money. We came here before we had kids and after and it's accommodating for both types of parties. The kid's menu has generous portions with one order feeding two small kids. The french onion soup is delish, the escargot is fresh, the steaks are always tasty and tender and the bananas foster crepe for dessert is to-die-for! Nice ambiance and most of the time the waiters are really nice.Quick tip: grab a seat on the patio and enjoy the free Bellagio show while you dine. Great distraction for little kids!"
946,"I am very conflicted about this place...The food was excellent.  Our personal server was polite and helpful.  But the host service was dreadful.  And because of that, I'm giving this place only 3 stars where it normally would earn 4 easy, maybe 5 on a good day.  Now let me explain...We had made reservation for our friend's birthday dinner.  To me, when you make a reservation (especially at a fine dining restaurant like Mon Ami) there are certain expectations that come along with that.  First and foremost, you expect to be seated in a reasonable amount of time.  We sat down at 9:00 for an 8:30 reservation!  Second, you expect the whole process to be relatively hassle-free...you give them your name and they seat at the table that is RESERVED for you.  But instead they handed up a pager and told us to wait.  When the pager went off they told us they could seat us outside (even though we requested indoor seating for the reservation) shortly or indoors in 5 minutes.  Now for most restaurants, I would be a lot more understanding of the hardworking host staff.  But for a place like this, part of the price of the meal goes towards the service offered by the establishment.  I felt we did not get that value on the night we dined.   All venting and ranting aside, the ambiance, food, and waiter service were excellent.  I would recommend the warm brie cheese and the sea scallops for hors d'oeuvres.  The bone-in ribeye is excellent, and strongly consider their specials.  Our group tried their roasted orange duck and sea bass, both very good.  In closing, chances are, that if you go on any random night, you will have a perfectly pleasant dining experience, but don't be shocked if you find yourself frustrated waiting for your reservation."
947,They have a dedicated gluten free menu! They have gluten free bread! Great sauces in all their dishes. Sit out side for a view of the Bellagio Fountains.
948,"One of my best dining experiences in Vegas.  About as European as a restaurant can get on this side of the Atlantic.  Entrees, wine, port, cheese tray, Cafe Americano.  Man, it was all good."
949,"Delicious food!! I love the steaks (I always have a Filet Mignon) with the Merlot Butter that melts and oozes flavor! I love the ""frites"" that come along the side (french fries). They are so yummy and I normally don't care for french fries.  I have been here about a dozen times and I am always impressed with the food and the quality of the items. It is a great date spot...has a romantic appeal to the atmosphere with great views of the Bellagio fountains if you get to sit outside.  Leave room for dessert and enjoy the most insane Bananas Foster Crepe!!   The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it is really pricey and you have to walk so far from the parking garage to get there. That might be a good thing after eating so much!!"
950,"Sometimes I feel like being the two F's. Fancy & French.  I like to wear pretty pretty dress, throw on some pearls and maybe throw on a beret and say ""Bon Appetit!""  Then I like to take a stroll down to Paris and eat brunch by the Eiffel Tower. What a life I live...Oh wait...did I forget to mention that stroll is to the Paris Las Vegas? Or that I eat my beautiful brunch at the DIVINE Mon Ami Gabi French Bistro that happens to be by the replica of the Eiffel Tower? Oh..I didn't?Not to fret! This truly is the next best thing when it comes to french cuisine and dining in Las Vegas.Mon Ami Gabi is truly one of my favorite places to eat in the city let alone on the Strip. They truly capture the classic french bistro from the decor of the restaurant to the meal that sits in front of you.  You can sit on the terrace as well as inside their beautiful what seems to look like an beautiful atrium. Either way you have a magnificent view of the Bellagio Fountains which play every 15-30 min. Meal and show! The food is absolutely delicious. My favorite breakfast item are the Blueberry Waffle and the Eggs Benedict The Blueberry Waffle is to crispy with a light airy inside which truly compliments the homemade blueberry glaze and fresh whipped cream. It is light as air ad doesn't give you the feeling of eating something heavy.  When it comes to the Eggs Benedict it revolves around one word : HOLLINDAISE. Hollindaise sauce is an emulsion of egg yolk and butter. It is a creamy delicious touch on top your poached eggs place on a slice of  french baguette. If you like French Onion you must try theirs! It is truly the best I have had in Vegas. The guryere cheese baked on top of the soup is amazing. I could possibly eat that alone. Now time for tips:1. If you plan on going on the weekend for any meal, I HIGHLY suggest you make a reservation.  They are very busy and the wait can be up to an hour.2. Try going during the week it is not as busy. 3. If it is blazing hot outside, do not sit on the terrace. You will fry. Plus the umbrellas don't move they are bolted into the ground. So shade is not always an optionPersonal Request:  Please say bon appetit...just for moi. I will love you forever. Pinky Promise. BON APPETIT MON ANGE!                           (my angel)"
951,"Great food, great view, and they are Open Table friendly making reservations a breeze.  The servers were extremely nice, knew the menu and gave great suggestions.  I ordered Stingray for the first time, and it was delicious! It has a surprisingly subtle taste, and the texture was so soft, it practically melted in my mouth.  Beautiful flavors soaked into the meat of the stingray, and accompanied my wine nicely.  It is served with garlic potato chips made from scratch.  Thin, crispy, and Delicious!  The prices are a little steep, but this is a great restaurant with great views of the Bellagio fountain show.  If you're staying at Paris Hotel, this is the only place worth eating at if you're looking for good food nearby; none of that buffet quality stuff you find everywhere else inside this hotel."
952,"This place was a huge surprise for me.  Most people go to Vegas and eat at the buffets.  Here's the thing, though: buffet food is usually crap.  At Mon Ami, for appetizers, entrees, and drinks you can have a meal that will fill you up and it will taste delicious-all for the price of a buffet on the strip.  For appetizers, we got the patte with baguettes.  I forgot the name, but it was the creamier, easier to spread patte.  It tasted great.  The bread is also straight from the oven (I don't know if it's entirely fresh, but it's good nonetheless).  It hit the spot right away.  For the entree, I ordered the steak frites with a mushroom sauce and my fiancee ordered the seared scallops.  The steak frites was excellent (the frites were a little to salty for my taste).  The seared scallops were cooked beautifully.  The service was great as well.  I will definitely come back whenever I make another Vegas trip."
953,"Surprised this place was so good.Service:Nothing to complain about. My friend's brother proposed to his girlfriend here & our waitress brought them complimentary champagne. Food:Pretty good! The Seafood Platter (shared it with a friend) was quite delectable. It came with a whole lobster, 4 oysters, 4 jumbo shrimps, a small side of seaweed salad, tuna tartare, Parmesan (? maybe garlic?) crisps, & 3 dipping sauces. Everything on that platter was really good. I ate some of my friend's green beans from her Filet Mignon plate & the sauce was really good. Their desserts are amazing. Pretty good Crème Brûlée!Prices:Main courses were reasonably priced, however, some items were a little pricey. Environment:It's really cute, French, & romantic! Would definitely recommend this place if you're going to stay at Paris or if you want French food."
954,"So disappointed.  There were five hostesses standing around as we showed up ten minutes early for our lunch reservation,. We were seated about 12 minutes after our requested time.  Once seated we waited forever for a server.  The entire experience was just SLOW.  My meal was just average, the salad was overdressed and we had to ask for water and more drinks.I was glad I did not suggest this restaurant since everyone in our group was let down"
955,"All the glowing Yelp reviews about Mon Ami Gabi are true. (Unlike others such as Del Friscos and Delmonicos that completely defy logic or reason).It's a great restaurant, with great food and excellent service, and an almost Parisian-atmosphere....but....but...but....But....the girls at the front; the ones who decide where to seat you...the ones who make you wait at the bar no matter how busy they are....those girls are abominable. They almost ruin everything that is good about MAG. They undermine the great business that it is.I wish the guys in Chicago, who created this concept, would find some hostesses....maitresse d's.....who were a little more hospitable, and a little less premenstrual.I'll keep going here because I think it's one of the best all-round restaurants on the strip....but I'd go a lot more if the she-devils weren't waiting to shred me and everyone else once we arrive."
956,"We came here for Sunday brunch on the first day of our Vegas trip.  We arrived around 11am after checking into our hotel.  We were starving and craving a nice breakfast.  However, we were sad to learn that unlike other restaurants we were used too, they weren't serving their usual breakfast menu at that time.  They had maybe 5 items on their brunch menu and the rest was off their lunch menu.  I specifically asked the waiter if any other breakfast items were available, but he was unaccomodating.  It was especially dissapointing because the table right next to us were able to order breakfast and they received their food less than 10 minutes before us. As for the food, my boyfriend ordered the waffle with fresh strawberries and whip cream.  It was $15 for ONE waffle that could have came out of a box.  The whip cream that everyone raves about was just meh!  But I must admit that I'm not a huge fan of whip cream in general (waste of calories for something that doesn't even taste that good).  I ordered the quiche which was ok but very rich.  You can definitely taste all the butter and cream they put in it.  It was more of a custard consistency than I'm used to though.  As for the service, our waiter basically sucked and seemed to have airs about him.  He spent most of the time talking in the corner with his friends.  My coffee was never refilled and it took us forever to get our check.  Then it took at least another 10-15 minutes for him to pick it up so he can run our credit card.  We don't usually ask much of our waiters and usually tip very well.  But this was rediculous!  He failed to realize that every minute of his inattentiveness was decreasing his tip.  But maybe the service is better on the outside patio.  We were just too hungry to wait for a table there.  It was immediate seating inside.  Still, a huge dissapointment all around.  Definitely not worth it when there are so many other places to eat on the strip."
957,"The must-gets are: thin steak w/ frites, escargot, and their frangria. Delicious food, great view, great service. Always have a good time here. Word of advice, try to not to go during regular lunch and dinner hours. Mid-afternoon is the best time to go to avoid long wait."
958,"I came here with my cousins and friends for my cousin's bachelorette dinner last weekend.  I ordered the prime rib special, which was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and was huge enough for me to have over 2 meals!  I also got the onion soup, which is supposed to be their best soup, but it was just a bit salty for me.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy it though.  My cousins had the seafood platter, which came with fresh lobster, oysters, shrimps, and tuna tartar.  It looked AMAZING! I only got to try the tuna tartar which was delicious, and my cousins were very happy with their choice of the seafood platter.The server was also very accommodating to our group of 12 ladies, and even brought out a complimentary dessert for the bride-to-be."
959,The fillWe got the fillet mignon with butter and the oysters for my birthday dinner. I loved LOVED the oysters. I live in San Diego where we can get fresh oysters easily - and I thought these were supremely fresh. It was a treat eating every single one of them. The fillet mignon was delicious. It was marinated well and had a hint of vietnamese flavor to it I felt like. I also liked how everyone got a baguette with butter before starting their meal. Is it just me or is the butter delicious here as well? YUM. And I could not have thought of a better way to celebrate a birthday =)
960,"Sat out on the patio to eat al fresco style. It was a great lunch we had, sipping rose champagne while eating our food. I ordered the croque monsieur. The bread was perfectly buttered and grilled with the ham/bechamel sauce/gruyere cheese. I've wanted to try one of these sandwiches for a while and had to take the opportunity to order one. The french fry/potato chip hybrid potatoes were yummy! It was perfectly crispy and thin all at the same time. Too bad more places don't offer this on their menu. I just wish the staff would have opened up the umbrellas, but supposedly it was a little too breezy. It had been several years since I'd eaten here and it was just as good as I remembered it. Can't wait to come back the next time I'm in Vegas."
961,"Went to Vegas for my birthday weekend and this was one of many places we went in between the gambling. The service here was excellent, food quality was awesome."
962,"I was here for the second time tonight and it was a very good evening.  We had the option to do the patio, but chose instead to eat in the open air area under the front roof but not on the outside patio itself because of the bright late afternoon sunshine.There were four of us.  Two got steaks with different sauces--one bordelaise and mine the roquefort.  The other main courses were the crab cake and the herb grilled chicken breast.  Two shared a side of macaroni and cheese and two shared the garlic spinach.The steaks for both of us were done perfectly just as we ordered.  The pommes frites were excellent.  The spinach and mac and cheese were both great!  We had an extremely pleasant dinner.  It was a fine evening with my wife and two good friends from the east.Of course the view of the Bellagio fountains across the street was very good.  This time I didn't notice Mon Ami silence their music so you could hear the fountain music.  Also, the restaurant was quite noisy.  Part of that was street noise.  I deduct a half point for that and although our server was basically good, a half point for forgetting to bring the iced teas until reminded 5 minutes later and for a general attitude that just seemed to rub me the wrong way.What better way to spend two hours on a summer evening than dining with 2 good friends, enjoying good conversation and have a very good meal!  I really like Mon Ami Gabi!A bientôt!"
963,By far my wife's favorite restaurant in town.  The French onion soup is out of this world and the skate fish entree is terrific.  Steaks are great and service is top notch.  This place is expensive so we do not get to eat here often but when we do it is always worth the money.
964,"Best French Onion soup I've ever had!!The bread at the beginning of the meal was delicious!We sat at the edge of the terrace on the inside of the restaurant, but still had a good view of the strip and people-watching. We stopped by Monday and easily got a reservation for 7:30 Tues night for 2.Steak was delicious in the herb butter, but the fries were more like potato chips, wasn't as big a fan. The steak was pretty big and I was full though, so I didn't eat a lot of them. Probably my only complaint.Sangria was good and they had Sam Adams for my husband. Really enjoyed our dinner!"
965,"Maybe I came on a bad day, but service was not up to par in comparison to all the other strip restaurants. The best part I could say I had was probably the complimentary baguette that was given in the beginning of our dinner. Our server took a while, but we were patient. I saw a sandwich from afar and asked her what kind it is and where one could find it on the menu. We missed the lunch menu but she said she would make an exception for me and order it. Turns out, it was a steak sandwich and I didn't feel like eating steak and asked for chicken instead. Grilled chicken breast with brie cheese and tangy granny smith apples. Sounds great right? It should be! Problem was, I had too much bread going on in my sandwich. Or not enough filler in between my bread. My eating companion got the classic steak and frites. He has had his fair share of French cuisine and stated he definitely had better, but it was decent. All in all, not sure if I would come back here next time I visit Vegas."
966,"Great food for the price.I had the roast chicken since I wasn't hungry enough for steak.  Good, not great. Cook perfectly!French Onion soup was so-so.Steaks are cut thin so dont expect anything thick and juicy but the flavors were great (sample from friends).The Liver mousse and event he free carrot salad for the bread was great!  Don't fill up on the bread as its very hard to stop eating it!"
967,"Best restaurant in Las Vegas.  Period.  The service is amazing.  The food is wonderful.  ""Classic Quiche Lorraine"" is a french dish with simple ingredients, Eggs, Bacon & Onion, but i have to say ""It's the best thing i ate in Vegas"".  Dont forget to make reservation.  Anyway, if you live or visit Vegas, you don't want to miss this awesome restaurant."
968,"Fantastic lunch spot with friends or your loved one. We were seated partly on the border of inside/outside the patio which was comfortable temperature wise with the a/c and outdoor desert heat. Their onion soup could of been hotter and arrived lukewarm at our table which made it difficult for the cheese on top to melt. Other than that, it was good and not too salty. The steak and frittes weren't very memorable nor was the crab cake. The view of the Bellagio fountains and people watching made up for the lunch quality."
969,"Whenever I come to Vegas I make sure to block out at least one day during lunch time to head to Mon Ami. Their croque monsieur is to die for and their french fries...yum! For dessert, I would pretty much select anything off of the menu. Everything is delicious. The ambiance just can't be beat either. I've been to Paris before and even though this is smack dab in the middle of the Vegas Strip, I still feel like I'm back in France when I come here. I prefer to sit out on the patio (yes, even during the blazing summer) but you have to get there early and line up if you want your pick of seats (or make a reservation for later on in the day) But trust me, it's worth it. The staff is always incredibly nice and attentive too. Definitely ""as good as it gets!"""
970,"Came here for dinner before my boyfriend and I went to see the Cirque Du Soleil show Mystere. I had looked at the menu earlier in the day and there were quite a few things that I was interested in, however we had eaten a larger lunch than we had anticipated and ended up just getting appetizers. Anyways, I got the Endive & Bleu Cheese salad--it was SO delicious! It is very simple; endive, bleu cheese, arugula, and grapes with a very light vinaigrette dressing. In the past the endive I have had has been slightly bitter, but this was just perfect! Also, the bleu cheese was pretty mild (which I prefer). Again, very simple but if you are looking for a salad before dinner I HIGHLY recommend it!My boyfriend got the french onion soup--it was alright, not the best I have had though. It wasn't horrible or anything, but I have made this type of soup before and I felt like mine was better! Oh well. Third thing we shared was the shrimp cocktail--with HUGE shrimp! Shrimp was good, so was the tartar sauce. Can't really mess it up too much..We tried the mojito as well (I was immediately drawn to it because it had St. Germain and Champagne in it..it was very good!) Their version of Sangria was delicious also.I guess this might not be the greatest review since we didn't really eat substantial food there lol, but I guess just try the salad, I swear it's amazing!"
971,"This was my first experience at Mon Ami and it was okay I must say. Yes, just okay.. The food was edible. Nothing to tell your friends about. Hostesses did not acknowledge my party of two. We decided to stop at the bar before being seated and she was a charm. Great conversation as well as delicious drinks. I recommend ordering the grape specialty cocktail! So we're seated and we get greeted by a wonderful Albanian server. She makes the experience better, we order, watch the beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountain Show, and end our visit. Overall as I said it was okay. I wouldn't come here again nor recommend this restaurant to anyone."
972,"ask for the patio seating so you can get a look at the bellagio fountains while stuffing yourself (trees are kinda blocking most of the views but it's nice to sit outside and be part of the strip during your dining experience.They served this amazing bread with pickled olive dish as I sat down which made me instantaneously happy.   Vegas tends to do that: they make you instantaneously happy or sad...and instantaneously broke (rarely rich).   Fries were unique and I really loved it (pretty addicting).  My ribeye was cooked more like a medium than medium rare and though it wasn't the best ribeye, it was good enough.not worth mentioning: not-so-great oysters and descent spinach/garlic dish .  Wait...I feel like I forget to mention something.  Oh yea, please treat yourself with their French Onion Soup and the white bread pudding!Wait can be long.  Make sure to have reservations."
973,"After hearing my aunt recommend Mon Ami Gabi for breakfast, my family decided to make our way over there when we made yet another trip to Vegas.I was glad to have arrived there at 8am on a weekday and be seated immediately, since I read reviews stating that it can get pretty busy on the weekends. We were seated right by the entrance of the patio, so we still got a great view of the strip without suffering from the infamous Vegas heat. The restaurant has a great ambiance and really makes you feel like you're in Paris! Our waitress was very attentive, friendly, and helpful, too, which I always, ALWAYS appreciate.I read some reviews mentioning the waffles were supposed to be good, so I ended up ordering the blueberry waffles. You yelpers definitely have good taste because holy crap those waffles were GOOOOOOD! They were fresh, tasted homemade (even better because I can't make waffles like they do) with nice crispy edges and a crunchy/soft middle. I was super impressed with the blueberries they used because each one was nice and sweet, not a sour one in the bunch they poured over my waffles! The whipped cream tasted homemade, too, which really made the waffles that much more amazing, so good. Seriously. I could've eaten the whipped cream with a spoon. And lastly, the warm, blueberry syrup was TDF - perfect amount of sweetness!I can't wait to come back and try their Filet Mignon w/ Merlot Butter Sauce!"
974,"This place was soooo good that we ate here twice during our 3-day stay in Vegas. The first time we went, I was feeling guilty the entire day being so glutinous in Vegas that I ordered the Ahi tuna salad. It was good, but I immediately regretted my decision after I tried my husband's steak and frites.  The next day, we came back and we both ordered the steak and frittes. The steak was tender and the caramelized onion sauce complimented it really well. I usually order my steak medium, but since the steak was really thin, I had to order it medium rare to prevent them from overcooking it. The frites were really good, too! It's even better after it's been soaked in the au jus. It's also reasonably priced for being on the strip! We were able to sit outside and do some people watching while eating our delicious food.  - I'm drooling just thinking about their steak and frites... YUM!"
975,"There is not a better place to dine alfresco on the strip. All the hustle and bustle of the strip for your viewing pleasure and you can see the Bellagio fountain across the street.  Definitely ask to sit on the patio or atrium.  Only in Vegas could they air condition the outside patio!The food and ambiance are 5 stars, service can be spotty at times but never bad.  The Steak Frites is to die for. The salads are super fresh and delicious and the onion soup is out of this world. This is the kind of place that you can bring kids and not feel out of place wearing shorts and a t-shirt but still get 5 star food and ambiance."
976,"I'm not sure if there's a better value for your money in Vegas. This was the best meal I've had in at least a year, and the total bill for two came out to under $100 (before tip, anyway).Just an excellent steakhouse with top notch service and quality in everything, from the cuts of meat to the sauces, the bread and even the French onion soup. I was shaking my head in disbelief at how good every bite was, and the bill was half of what I'd expect given the quality and service. Highest recommendation."
977,"Amazing, delicious!  We were in Vegas for 4 days and went to this restaurant 4 times!Warm Chicken and Brie sandwich for lunch is delicious!Scallops dinner entree is also amazing. Service is top notch. By far the best service and food at reasonable prices in all of Vegas!"
978,"I've been meaning to write a review for this place for awhile now.. I've probably been here about four times? HIGHLY recommend this place. I feel like a lot of places in Vegas are overrated and overly-pretentious... but not this place! Best of all, I feel like it's the best bang for your buck! The service here is FANTASTIC. I've never been disappointed with anyone.. starting with the hostess, to the waiter/waitresses. Everyone is super friendly and very attentive! You can't make a reservation to sit in the patio, but this last time around, we came here at 6:30pm (for party of 2) with a normal reservation. We just ended up waiting 15 minutes to sit at the patio (they do not take reservations for the patio) so that we can watch the Bellagio fountain show! Sitting in the patio can be quite romantic and cute! :) I've gotten the steak here a bunch of times which is always good. This last time around, had the seafood platter for two (lobster, shrimp, oysters, tuna tartar).. especially on a hot day, I'd highly recommend it! The tuna tartar was VERY good. The only thing I did not like food-wise from my experience so far.. was their chilled soup of the day. I forget exactly what it's called, but something with almonds and grapes? NOT good. For the appetizer - I've also had the chilled gazpacho with avocado.. THAT was delicious! (and good during the summer time)Overall - I'd highly recommend! Great food, great service.. and won't burn a hole in your wallet ;)"
979,"We eat here everytime we visit Vegas, at least twice a year. The service is always excellent and we always enjoy a bottle of wine on the patio watching the Bellagio fountain show. I ALWAYS get the lemon chicken ... its amazing. We have never had a disappointing expeirance here."
980,"Good food, good sangria, and a fantastic view of the Bellagio fountain!  My lunch at Mon Ami Gabi was simple and delicious, and I found myself staring at other tables' food as well.  I had a salad and the crab cake appetizer and my friend said her summer tomato and avocado salad was perfect.  Plus, they had nice misters to save us from the heat!"
981,Great dinner for a decent Vegas price. Crab cake was pretty good but the grape and almond soup de jour was delicious and different.
982,"SCALLOPS(suggestion from waiter): Excellent.FILET MIGNON WITH MERLOT BUTTER: AhhhmazingBONE-IN RIBEYE: Ahhhmazing again.Boyfriend and I came here for our 5 year anniversary on July 4th with a reservation that I made on yelp. Our waiter was really informative (like naming everything on the menu - not to lie, I lost him after ""I'm your waiter for the night""). Long story short, it was a BEAUTIFUL dinner!! The waiter suggested the scallops and it was a great choice! The filet mignon was really tender and the bone-in ribeye was like the size of my face (no joke and it was really REALLy good with the berenaise). The waiter was cool and attentive but after we got our entrees, he totally ignored us (minus a star). BUT our drinks were always full because of the other guy, who was really nice. I would definitely eat here again. Mouth is watering as we speak . -____-"
983,"Love this place!  Great location overlooking the Belagio water show. A great romantic and relaxing environment, great service and great food!  Make reservations!  This place is always busy! Be brave and try a new dish! Dress how you like but dressy is more appropriate for this restaurant!"
984,"I ate here late night after an up night of gambling.  I ordered the following:Filet MignonSeafood PlatterSkate WingFrench Onion soupThe steak didnt have much flava, even though it was cooked pretty nicely.  That means the meat was not AAAAA+, so veer away from that one.The seafood platter was impressive.  It came with an entire lobster, oysters, shrimp, seaweed salad and tuna tartare.  The lobster doesn't come cracked, so prepare to get dirty.  This dish was $$$ but the lobster is def worth it.  My girl and her mommy loved the tuna tartare with big chunks of Ahi and Avo combo!Sting ray you say?!  Aye mateeeee!  Def get this one.  The texture is like a more tender version of scallops.French onion soup.  This one was in alot of the reviews and it was good.  Heavy on the cheese, and a hint of sweetness from the onions.  But $8 for a small bowl of soup?!  Better get lucky from the tables games then."
985,"Spent a week in Vegas and had three breakfast's here. Service is very good, especially for Vegas in the morning.The corned beef hash is extraordinary and they make the corned beef in house, large succulent chunks of meat not the mush typically found in other restaurants.Egg white and turkey omelet was great too (for an egg white omelet)Last breakfast there I had the brie and mushroom omelet, it was fantastic! My wife had the french toast which consisted of huge slices (2""+ thick) of Mon Ami's, made in house, brioche and blueberry coulis other than the sugar high that wore off a couple hours later this was easily the best french toast either of us had ever had.The only downside of Mon Ami, other than the location 1,500 miles from me, is that it makes homemade breakfast seem pitiful in comparison."
986,"I sort of hate to admit that one of my absolute favorite places to eat in Vegas and someplace we eat at at least once or twice each trip is a hotel restaurant, but the food is just plain awesome!  Breakfast s great and the people watching, if you sit outside, is the best show in town. What can be more fun than eggs at 7:30 am while watching the wrecked people stumble by that haven't been to bed yet."
987,"So, so good! Do not miss a chance to eat here - you will not be disappointed! We came through Vegas on a road trip and had breakfast, and it was so amazing, we had to eat here on the way back! Everything was fresh, presented beautifully, and absolutely delicious. Things we ordered: Eggs Benedict, Big Skinny Pancakes (Cinnamon), Blueberry French Toast, Eggs Florentine, Bacon egg and cheese Crepes, sides of bacon and fruit,  Smoked salmon plate, Cinnamon Bun, and Apple Crumb Coffee Cake (over two visits and 6 people! ). EVERYTHING was absolutely delicious. We were all swooning over the cinnamon pancakes (really crepes), they had a crust like creme brule, oh my. The bacon was SO good, crispy and flavorful, just totally thick, flat and savory. You bacon lovers know what I'm talking about! The coffee was fantastic, the wonderful server kept my cup full, SUCH good service! She even gave me a slip to request recipes from the chef, wow! It was above and beyond. We sat indoors because of the heat, but the windows are large and they keep the big doors open with the air on, so you still have the benefit of terrace seating without the disadvantages . While a bit pricey for 6, (and an 18% gratuity is charged for parties of 5 or more ), it was a worthwhile spluge! SO SO GOOD!"
988,"This is my favorite restaurant on the Strip. Sure it looks gimmicky because it's right in the middle and has a gorgeous patio view that overlooks the Bellagio fountain, but location aside, the food and service here are fantastic. I've been here for dinner and lunch. The dinner I don't remember much of due to the great bottle of wine my friend and I shared, but I do remember we were sitting on the outside patio and it does feel a little bit crammed in there. The meal made up for it- I know I had some kinda steak with bearnaise sauce that was to-die-for. During my most recent Vegas trip I had lunch: a croque madame (fried egg on top of an open faced hot ham and gruyere cheese sandwich) and French onion soup. The croque madame was perfect and in a much larger portion than I expected. It comes with a side of pomme frites. The French onion soup was nothing special but I'm a sucker for anything with gruyere cheese so I still enjoyed it even though the soup inside was a bit cold. They also include a fresh baguette with your meal. So all of that plus a glass of their sangria called ""Frangria"" and I was set for the rest of the day. Je t'aime Mon Ami Gabi!"
989,Went there with a party of 13 and the service and food was excellent.  This is an excellent choice for a mid-priced meal in Vegas.  Call ahead though they were telling people at the door 45 - 60 minute wait times.
990,"Thanks to birthday girl this was a nice spot to enjoy a nice evening talking about random things not meant for the dinner table! Haha.. good times! Nice view of that fountain across the street weeee...I thought we're in a drought? Great for people watching if you're sitting in the patio. We sat inside, but it was still kinda hot. We all had a bite of the dishes we ordered... I really enjoyed my flattened herb chicken breast and salad. Mmmm butter! I also liked the filet mignon...soft and tender...Yes...order a bottle of wine to go with your meal. You might as well if you're going to have more than one glass!"
991,"Food: 4Service: 3Ambiance: 3Food: This place has really great french onion soup and I love french onion soup.  Not the best ive had, but its damn close.  My fiance had a burger, it was ok and the steak and frites I had was decent enough.  Recommendation: French Onion soup, Carrot salad (complimentary)Service: Our waiter that night was friendly and helpful.Ambiance: Standard for a restaurant of that caliber.  Last words:  Would come back for the soup."
992,"If you're like me who would rather not dine buffet-style and who detests waiting in long lines for a table in a restaurant, Mon Ami Gabi provides an excellent alternative for food when you're in Vegas. Compared to the long line at the buffet in Paris Vegas inside the building, Mon Ami Gabi had tables immediately available when I visited over Fourth of July weekend. Seating on the porch was great to catch the fountain shows in the afternoon at Bellagio right across from the street, and the mist on the porch helped keep the temperature down even though tables were outside while it was over 100 degrees in the city."
993,"Everyone in your party must be present before you can be seated. Luckily, they don't have some odd policy about showing up late for a reservation.I already liked the place as soon as I walked in... a candle at every table created a relatively peaceful environment as opposed to the noisy and busy Las Vegas lifestyle.I started off with soup du jour (soup of the day) which was chilled potato soup with bread crumbs. It did not suit my taste at all. I had 1/3 spoonful and that was the end of it. I feel terrible for wasting food like that, but I couldn't stand it, and I'm even a huge fan of potato-related food!For my entree, I ordered Sea Scallops, and I must say it was delicious. It was a plate of 5 or 6 pieces of baked scallops in veloute sauce, mushrooms, and asparagus. Though the portion was quite small, I enjoyed every bite.Unfortunately my friends didn't have a very wonderful time with their steak orders, two of which were Steak Au Poivre and Bearnaise. On the bright side, those orders came with their signature hand-cut fries. And man oh man, those were crisp, chew, and addicting!Also, we had a pretty nice view of the Bellagio fountain!"
994,"I came here for lunch with my boyfriend and had a great experience. We requested to sit on the inside of the patio so we could have a view, and not be scorched by the sun! They were very accommodating It felt like a lovely little bistro, but with the Bellagio sitting right ahead. The waiters were nice and helpful. I ordered an off-menu frisée salad that was served over lightly marinated asparagus, and featured a nice poached egg on top. The dressing was light and fresh, and had delicious bits of orange pulp. It had a great combination of flavors that I thoroughly enjoyed. My boyfriend ordered the scallops with caramelized onions and fennel, which were served on cute metal ""sea shells"". He licked it up. We finished lunch off with the obligatory coffee and latte - a nice pause in a busy city. We'll likely be back again!"
995,"On a hot day in vegas, you would think sitting outside would be a bad idea right?  It's actually pretty cool outside. You also get a perfect view of the Bellagio fountains right across the restaurant! The inside is so dim...you can't really see your food.. but I guess it's okay if you're on a date it could be ""romantic"".Service is great. Food is delicious. Price is reasonable. More details on food later."
996,"My girls and I felt like we were on the scenes of ""Sex and the City"" as we sat, chat, sipped on some mimosas, and ate brunch outdoors of Mon Ami Gabi. The staff here is very professional and provides great service and personal opinions of what dishes are good. I asked about the Chocolate-Bacon Waffle ($11.95), and the server highly recommended it and was one of her favorites. So that's what I got. Who cares if the combination sounds funny? The mix of sweet and salty flavor was superb. My girlfriends thought it was interesting too and was skeptical to try my dish, but when one was brave enough and thought it was good, the others followed and decided to give it a shot. Well aren't they glad they did."
997,"Ate at Mon Ami Gabi for Dinner. I made the reservation via Yelp/Open Table. We had:Carafe of ""Frangria"": sweet, refreshing french version of sangriaBaked Cheese: it was okay. tangy tomato sauce with a soft baked cheese in the middle served with a baguette baked with butter and herbs. It was alright, but should've stuck with the french onion soup.Bordelaise Steak and Frites: Thin steak that was perfectly prepared medium as requested. Frites were fresh and crispy. Bone-in Rib Eye and Frites: Flavorful and tender 22oz steak served with a side of Bernaise sauce. I didn't need the sauce since the steak was so flavorful. Frites were delicious and addicting.Our dining experience was great. Service was helpful however ""quiet. Sorry, no dessert as we were stuffed. I recommend that you try sitting on the patio for the people watching action. Vegas never ceases to amaze with stupid human behavior. Watch the Bellagio water show on the patio too."
998,"Was here for a conference and LOVED the ambiance in here. Patio and cozy, breezy experience was great for breakfast. I especially appreciated the great service and well made breakfast that I had. Not usually in Vegas but next time I come, I'll be here for dinner."
999,"Had a great happy hour cocktail and some wonderful starters. I highly recommend the smoked salmon with creme fraiche, red onion and capers. I also really enjoyed the butter lettuce and apple salad! It had a great combination of roasted beets (not usually a fan of, but they pulled it off) with goat cheese and an apple cider vinagrette!  Food, ambiance and service was fantastic...as usual!!!"
1000,"I had a $25 lettuce entertain you gift card so I brought it with me to Las Vegas and had a very pricey breakfast, but ... no complaints, it was good.We got seated right away outside, it was still reasonably comfortable enough to eat outside in July in Las Vegas.  We were told the specials, I opted for one of them - a fancy eggs benedict and apple juice, which was a lighter color as it was REAL apple juice, not the kind from a machine or bottle.  We also started our meal with a blackberry bran muffin which was super yummy."
