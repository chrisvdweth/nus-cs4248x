    "# Vector Space Model (VSM)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Vector Space Model (VSM)** is a fundamental concept in Natural Language Processing that represents textual documents as numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space. It is a mathematical framework that allows us to analyze and compare documents based on their semantic similarity. In the VSM, each document is typically represented as a vector where each dimension corresponds to a particular term or word in the document. The value of each dimension in the vector represents the importance or presence of that term in the document. The choice of representation can vary, but common approaches include using term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weights or binary values (indicating term presence or absence).\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the VSM, a corpus of documents is first constructed, and a vocabulary is formed by extracting unique terms from the documents. Then, each document is transformed into a vector by assigning appropriate weights to the terms based on their occurrences or importance in the document. Once the documents are represented as vectors, various mathematical operations can be performed to analyze the relationships between documents. These operations include measuring the cosine similarity or Euclidean distance between document vectors to determine their similarity or dissimilarity. Vector space models enable tasks such as document classification, information retrieval, document clustering, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the advantages of the vector space model is that it allows us to capture the semantic meaning of documents and compare them in a quantitative manner. However, it does not explicitly model the grammar or syntactic structure of the text. Nonetheless, it forms the basis for many advanced NLP techniques and models such as text classification."

    "\n",
    "Since transforming a corpus into a term-document matrix, all popular NLP toolkits provide respective class and/or methods. The `CountVectorizer` is a class in the scikit-learn library. It is a feature extraction tool specifically designed for converting text documents into numerical feature vectors based on the VSM. The CountVectorizer implements the process of tokenizing, counting, and creating a term-document matrix based on the term frequencies.\n",

Some common parameters include `lowercase`, `stop_words`, `tokenizer`, and `ngram_range`, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fitting and Transforming:** Once the `CountVectorizer` instance is created, you can fit it on your corpus of documents using the `fit_transform()` method. This step learns the vocabulary from the corpus and transforms the input documents into a term-document matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Obtaining the Term-Document Matrix:** After fitting the `CountVectorizer`, you can access the term-document matrix using the `transform()` method. This method takes new text documents as input and returns their corresponding numerical representation based on the learned vocabulary.\n",

    "Let's define an instance of the `CountVectorizer` using its default values (cf. the [docs](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) for more details)\n"

    "\n",
    "The TF term-document matrix provides a basic representation of the term frequencies in the corpus. However, it doesn't take into account the relative importance of terms in the entire document collection. To address this limitation and give more weight to terms that are relatively rare but informative, other techniques like inverse document frequency (IDF) or TF-IDF weighting are often applied in conjunction with the TF term-document matrix.\n",

    "The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) term-document matrix takes into account the importance of each term in a document relative to the entire collection of documents.

    "\n",
    "* **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** Calculate the inverse document frequency of each term. IDF quantifies the rarity of a term across the entire document collection. Terms that appear in many documents have lower IDF values, while terms that appear in a few documents have higher IDF values. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **TF-IDF:** Multiply the term frequency (TF) of each term in a document by its inverse document frequency (IDF) to obtain the TF-IDF weight for that term in that document. This step assigns higher weights to terms that are frequent in a document but rare in the entire collection, emphasizing their importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Building the matrix:** Each document is represented as a vector where each element corresponds to the TF-IDF weight of a term in that document. All the document vectors are then stacked together to form the TF-IDF term-document matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "An element in the TF-IDF term-document matrix (tf = term frequency; idf = inverse document frequency) for a term $t_i$ and a document $d_j$ is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$tfidf(t_i, d_j) = tf(t_i, d_j) \\cdot idf(t_i, d_j)$$\n",

    "$$ idf(t_i, d_j) = \\log{\\frac{total\\ number\\ of\\ documents}{number\\ of\\ terms\\ containing\\ t_i}} $$\n",

    "The vector space model (VSM) is a mathematical framework for representing text documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space. It forms the basis for various information retrieval and text mining techniques. In the VSM, each document is represented as a vector, and each dimension of the vector corresponds to a term or word in the document collection. The values in the vector represent the importance or weight of each term in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vector space model allows for efficient and flexible retrieval of documents based on their relevance to a query. Similarity between documents or between a document and a query can be measured using various distance metrics, such as cosine similarity. By mapping documents into a vector space, the VSM provides a quantitative representation of text, enabling computational techniques to analyze and compare documents based on their content. The vector space model is widely used in applications such as information retrieval, document clustering, text classification, and recommendation systems."
