    "# Data Preparation: Machine Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine translation in NLP refers to the use of computer algorithms and models to automatically translate text or speech from one language to another. It is a subfield of NLP that focuses on developing systems that can bridge the language barrier and facilitate communication between people who speak different languages. Machine translation systems aim to replicate the process of human translation by analyzing the structure, grammar, and meaning of the source language text and generating an equivalent translation in the target language. These systems employ various techniques, including statistical methods, rule-based approaches, and more recently, neural machine translation (NMT) models.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Statistical machine translation (SMT)** was the dominant approach before the rise of neural machine translation. SMT involves training models on large bilingual corpora, extracting patterns, and using statistical algorithms to generate translations. However, SMT often requires extensive manual feature engineering and may struggle with translating rare or unseen phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Neural machine translation (NMT)** has emerged as a powerful approach, leveraging deep learning techniques to improve translation quality. NMT models, particularly sequence-to-sequence models with recurrent or transformer architectures, learn to directly map source language sentences to target language sentences. They do not rely on explicit alignment models or handcrafted linguistic features, enabling end-to-end learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "NMT models are trained on parallel corpora, which consist of pairs of sentences in the source and target languages. During training, the models learn to encode the source sentence into a continuous representation, often using an encoder network, and then decode this representation into the target language sentence using a decoder network. The models are optimized to minimize the difference between the generated translation and the reference translation in the training data. There have been significant advancements in recent years, but challenges still remain, particularly in handling ambiguous or context-dependent language, translating idioms, and capturing nuances of meaning. Ongoing research and advancements in NLP continue to push the boundaries of machine translation capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will create a dataset to train machine learning models using publicly available corpora. The scale of this dataset will be rather limited and certainly insufficient to train a state-of-the-art machine translation model."

    "## Download & Generate Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a machine learning model typically requires a large dataset of text documents and their corresponding translation in the one or more target languages. Collecting corpora for training machine translation models involves several steps. Here's an overview of the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Determine Source and Target Languages:** First, identify the specific languages you want to train your machine translation model on. The choice of languages depends on your target audience and the availability of resources in those languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Obtain Parallel Corpora:** Parallel corpora are collections of sentences or texts that have translations available in both the source and target languages. These corpora are essential for training machine translation models. There are several sources to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t* Publicly Available Corpora: Explore publicly available parallel corpora, such as those provided by research institutions, organizations, or language-related projects. Some examples include the Europarl corpus, United Nations documents, or the Tatoeba project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t* Government and Legal Translations: Government websites, legislative documents, legal agreements, and court proceedings often have translated versions available. These can be a valuable resource for specific domains or language pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t* News Articles and Publications: News organizations and publishers may have translated articles or publications that can be used as parallel corpora. This can provide a diverse range of topics and sentence structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t* Crowdsourcing: Consider utilizing crowdsourcing platforms to collect translations. Platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk or specialized translation communities can help in gathering sentence pairs for your target language pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Ensure Data Quality and Preprocessing:** After obtaining parallel corpora, it is important to ensure data quality and perform preprocessing steps. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t* Removing noisy or irrelevant data: Review the data and remove any sentences or segments that are low quality, incorrect, or contain undesirable characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t* Tokenization: Tokenize sentences into individual words or subword units. This step is crucial for building vocabulary and preparing data for input to the machine translation model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t* Cleaning and Normalization: Normalize the data by removing unnecessary punctuation, correcting spelling mistakes, or handling special characters specific to the languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Align Sentences:** For training machine translation models, it is crucial to align the sentences in the parallel corpora, i.e., to establish which sentence in the source language corresponds to which sentence in the target language. Alignment can be done manually or with the help of alignment tools such as FastAlign or GIZA++.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corpus Size and Balance:** Consider the size of your corpus. Larger corpora can provide better coverage and generalization. Additionally, ensure the balance between the source and target languages, so that both languages have roughly equal representation to avoid bias in translation quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pretraining and Fine-tuning:** Machine translation models, particularly neural network-based models, often benefit from pretraining on a large dataset and then fine-tuning on a domain-specific or smaller dataset. This allows the model to learn general language patterns before focusing on the specific translation task.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that collecting corpora for machine translation can be a complex and time-consuming process, especially for low-resource languages or specialized domains. The availability of quality parallel corpora directly affects the translation quality of the trained models. Therefore, it is essential to invest effort into obtaining high-quality and diverse corpora for effective machine translation training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source: Tatoeba\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we rely on [Tatoeba](https://tatoeba.org/en/) to collect our text corpus for generating our dataset(s). The Tatoeba website is a collaborative online platform that aims to collect and provide example sentences and translations in multiple languages. The word \"tatoeba\" means \"for example\" in Japanese, reflecting the purpose of the platform—to provide examples for various languages and contexts. The website's main goal is to create a large and diverse sentence database that can be used for language learning, translation, and linguistic research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users of Tatoeba can contribute by submitting new sentences in any language, along with their translations into other languages. The sentences can cover a wide range of topics, allowing learners and researchers to explore different domains and language usage. The website follows a community-driven approach, where registered users can suggest corrections, discuss translations, and engage in collaborative efforts to improve the quality and accuracy of the sentence database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tatoeba provides various features and tools to facilitate language exploration and learning. Users can search for sentences, filter by language, browse through curated lists, and save their favorite sentences. The translations provided on Tatoeba are typically contributed by volunteers, so the quality may vary, but the community actively works on improving and reviewing the translations over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tatoeba project promotes open data and open-source principles. The sentence database and its source code are freely available, allowing others to reuse and build upon them. This openness enables researchers, developers, and language enthusiasts to create applications, tools, and resources that leverage the sentence data for diverse language-related tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Auxiliary Method for Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Tatoeba makes all sentences of a language available as a single compressed file. However, downloading these 2 files for the source and target language is not sufficient as they lack the connection which sentence in the source file matches which sentences in the target file. To make this connection requires an additional file containing the information about the links between sentences of different languages. The method `generate_sentence_pairs()` in the code cell below automates this process. It takes the identifiers of the source and target language as input and creates a new text file containing all matching sentence pairs between the two languages. While the first half of the method code handles downloading and decompressing the required files, the second half performs the linking between the 2 language files."

    "Collecting and preparing datasets for training machine translation models is a crucial step in building high-quality translation systems. The process involves sourcing parallel corpora, which consist of sentences or texts in the source language along with their translations in the target language. These corpora can be obtained from various sources such as public repositories, government documents, news articles, or through crowdsourcing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the parallel corpora are acquired, preprocessing steps are applied to clean and normalize the data. This includes tokenization to split sentences into words or subword units, lowercasing, handling special characters, and cleaning the text by removing noise, punctuation, and irrelevant information. Sentence alignment ensures that each sentence in the source language corresponds correctly to its translation in the target language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, data augmentation techniques can be employed to increase the dataset size and improve model performance. Techniques like back-translation and sentence length filtering can be applied to augment and filter the dataset, respectively. These preprocessing steps ensure that the data is in a suitable format for training the machine translation models, enabling effective learning of language patterns and translation mappings."
